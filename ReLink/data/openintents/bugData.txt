This is fine, but a remote application needs a way to detect this situation, either by an intent which can query the preference, or by a meaningful return error code.       ()                 Labels: -Priority-Medium Priority-High               This is so that remote applications might detect the user's preference and ask them if they'd like to change it if they want to continue using this application.                  Summary: OI Safe should provide a way for external applications to know if the user's preference is to disallow external access               I think this should be handled by OI Safe itself.  It should prompt the user for granting external access.  Later this could be changed to a finer level of control, depending on which package  is requesting information.

There is no return error code, but the user is prompted every time they do not allow  access.

You should see multiple "foo" entries     Expect to see only 1 "foo" entry.  I fixed something similar before, so I suspect this has to do with making sure we set a global password entry ID number someplace.  I will say "critical" since, although this doesn't seem to cause information loss, it could cause severe confusion if multiple entries exist ie if the user changes the password in one of them.

"Crypto error:Salt must not be null."  Sometimes I get the message as a popup (multiple times) and still CAN enter the front door password. Sometimes the app force closes and sometimes the message does not appear at all. As far as I can tell, the DB is ok and I can login in all cases. Except forced close of course, but the next launch of the app behaves just normal again.  What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? 1.0.0         I've seen this error as well.  Unfortunately I'm not able to create a series of steps to follow in order to duplicate it at will.  This error is emitted from AskPassword.java and IntentHandler.java.                 Labels: Stack-Safe               This also happens to me on the Android Developer Phone 1, latest version of OI  Safe.  I haven't yet identified any pattern to when it happens.        Fixing this bug seems to be as simple as adding a "return;" statement after the call  to finish(); in CategoryList.java's onCreate() method when !isSignedIn() is true.   If you don't return at that point, the category list activity continues and tries to  show the list of password cateogries, but it can't because the salt (and the master  password) are null, so it crashes the activity.  I've compiled the change into a  debug build and am testing it on my phone.  Can one of the maintainers make this  change and make it available in the public release or is there a process where I can  submit the code change (it says I need to be a member)?        Possibly fixed in r1967.  kanisdragon, I only just saw your comment.   Thanks for digging into it.   Please do an svn update and try my release.   If what you say is true, than my understanding of finish() is flawed.   I understand that when finish() is called, that it behaves like a return;  Were you ever able to reproduce the bug on demand?  I wasn't.  So I just added some checks in IntentHandler to see if salt was empty or null.   If finish() doesn't immediately return, I think it'd be better in CategoryList to do the same check salt for null or empty.  Since adding the check I haven't seen the salt error on my phone.   But I could just be getting lucky as of late.  :)                 Status: AcceptedOwner: rmceoin               Well, think about it.  "return" is a Java language construct that returns from the  current function, possibly including a result.  "finish()" is just a function call.   Once the finish function is done being called, code execution continues on the line  after the call to finish().  If you don't put a "return" statement after  your "finish" function, then the code beyond it will execute using a null salt.  I discovered this bug appears in more places than just CategoryList.  I got a LogCat  showing a trace back to the onCreate method of the PassList activity which also  assumes finish() returns and leads to the null salt error.  So I started going  through the classes one by one and I found a lot of them have this problem.  I also  found that some will just call finish() if CategoryList.isSignedIn() == false, while  others will first launch the FrontDoor intent, then call finish.  I couldn't divine  why some launch FrontDoor and others didn't, and I think it's a bug.  Some classes,  like ChangePass, don't check isSignedIn at all in the onResume method, so you can go  do something else, let the key expire, and return to the change password activity  without having to sign in.  That probably isn't a security problem unless you left  the old password typed in there.  If you want to reproduce some of these cases more  easily, call CategoryList.setSignedOut in the onPause method of any of these  activities, then navigate to another program and return.  There is also something going on with onCreate being called instead of onResume.   The stack trace where I saw salt is null for PassList occured in onCreate...  Somehow, after the safe logged me out, when I returned to it, it created the  PassList activity instead of the CategoryList activity.  I don't know if that's  because the operating system will remember what activity you were last viewing even  if that activity has been destroyed, or if that's some memory feature of Password  Safe.  Either way, you do have to check isSignedIn in both onCreate and onResume of  ALL activity classes.  So last night I started going through each class and doing just that, but I didn't  get that far.  I can continue doing that and post the changes, or if you'd rather  fix it in some other way, that's cool, but right now there's a lot of places where  the salt error could occur.        Sure enough, you're right!  I poked around in the ApiDemos and they absolutely stick a return; in where it's appropriate.  I've updated all finish() calls to have a return;.   Plus I ran through every activity and ensured that the onCreate() and onResume() had the appropriate check for isSignedIn().  For a couple of activities I needed to create an onResume() to even check, but they should all have it now.  Please check out the latest revision 1972.   Your feedback is great, thank you.                  Status: Started               I've been running it for a few days with no salt is null errors, but then again  those errors are hard to reproduce sometimes.  As long as you check the password in  all those onCreate/onResume events I think the error should be gone.  However, I've noticed two new oddities...  One is that I think I was viewing a  password, turned off the screen, turned on the screen immediately, I see the  password window, but I also see the key icon like I've entered the password.   Clicking the key says I've entered the password, but clicking the open safe gets me  the password entry.  Then I did the same thing again but this time turned off the  screen when I was on the change master password screen, and this time the key was  gone when I turned on the screen.  The second thing seems far more serious.  I'm looking at a password with the screen  set to never time out... and it's been showing me that password for at least an  hour.  Isn't it supposed to return to the password prompt after ten mins?  I'll  capture a log if you want to contact me for it.        I've seen the oddity where you screen off/on but the key icon is still in the notification as if the safe is unlocked, but when you launch the safe it still asks for the password.   More of an annoying bug.   I can't duplicate it on command.  The second oddity I have not seen and cannot duplicate.        I've only seen the screen showing your password data forever happen once, but it  still seems fairly serious.  Unfortunately the log I captured is useless because  it's filled with crap from another application so you can't see anything from when  the safe was first opened.  All it shows is when I turned off the screen and turned  it on again, it prompted me for my password.  Also, since I posted my last message, four times I have clicked the OI Safe icon and  it flashed the password screen for a moment and then went back to the home screen  with no error displayed.

Originally there was "OI Shopping list". Currently it displays "Shopping"  to indicate the shopping mode.

Monson:  "If you have an encrypted notepad note open and you lock oi safe, or turn your phone off, or anything that lock its automatically; then go to open that note, it first prompts you with the password screen but if you hit the back button it displays "failed to invoke encrypt" and displays the encrypted file. This seems to be a big security hole."    1. Open encrypted note in OI Notepad. 2. Lock OI Safe through notification bar. 3. Press back.    One still sees the content of the encrypted note, even though the user has logged out of OI Safe. It should never show the content of the note while being logged out.  This note is cached in OI Notepad. This cache should be deleted as soon as the user logs out of OI Safe.      Fixed in r2511. Will be available in OI Notepad 1.1.4.

While viewing the categories, press menu and select Lock.    This brings you back to the login page. 4. Press menu, and select Switch mode. 5. Press Continue.     I would expect a "wrong password" message, or something similar.  Instead,  I find myself viewing the categories.  The key notification appears.  It  is possible to view any password, just as if I had entered the correct  master password.  What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?  Presumably version 1.1.1, since Android Market does not tell me that I can  upgrade, and that is the version that Android Market currently has.  I'm using Android (Cupcake) on a HTC Magic.          It is possible to enter OI Safe using the same bypass even if you have just booted  your phone and never entered the master password in that session.  In that case,  however, the category listing is blank, so you cannot access the passwords.  Speculation: OI Safe seems to not remove the master password and/or decrypted master  key when it is locked.  I strongly think it should do so, to make it harder to  attack the safe.  I want my passwords to be encrypted, not just locked behind a  password as it seems to be right now.  Locks can be broken.  Breaking properly  designed and implemented encryption is much harder.        Unable to duplicate in OI Safe 1.2.3.        I also can not reproduce this in 1.2.4.  I'll mark it as fixed for now.

Start OI Shopping list    Expected is just the last shopping list that was open. Instead, I see last  shopping list that was open, but half the screen is now obscured by on- screen keyboard because input focus is on the box for adding new item. If  input focus was not on add new item box, then maybe on screen keyboard  would not pop up every time.  What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? - OI Shopping list Version 1.1.2 - HTC Hero with 1.5 Firmware (ROM 2.73.110.26) - Please note HTC Hero does not have hardware keyboard.    This bug is very annoying when using program frequently. One reason is  because it takes up half the screen, so not possible just to ignore the  keyboard. Secondly, there is a lag while the keyboard scrolls up, and then  when I dismiss the keyboard, another lag while waiting for it to disappear.   This lag is very frustrating when actually doing the shopping, since every  time loading the program becomes a hassle.     This bug does not occur on every device. For example, on the T-mobile G1 it does not  occur. Probably we need a device-specific bug fix.                 Status: AcceptedLabels: Stack-Shopping               Possibly fixed in r2421.

281	Defect	Fixed	rmce...@gmail.com	aripol...@gmail.com	1275998218000	1293675387000	1293675387000	OI Safe should handle database problems more gracefully	 For whatever reason, the permissions on my OI Safe database were messed up.  When using OI Safe 1.2.4 and trying to add a new password entry, things started acting weird in the application; a new entry would show up in the list, but tapping the entry did nothing. Only after I did a logcat did I find out that there was some database weirdness going on. There should probably be at least a toast or something telling the user that there was a problem updating the database, which could happen if the device's memory is full.  Here's the log:  06-08 22:45:16.843: INFO/Database(21043): sqlite returned: error code = 8, msg = prepared statement aborts at 33: [INSERT INTO passwords(username, category, lastdatetimeedit, website, unique_name, description, password, note) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);] 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043): Error inserting username=b1953bf43a1c39552a2e549215f9decb category=2 lastdatetimeedit=Jun 8, 2010 10:45:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time website=b1953bf43a1c39552a2e549215f9decb unique_name= description=8f512c5943efe78c465b0a0878cdb25f password=b1953bf43a1c39552a2e549215f9decb note=8f512c5943efe78c465b0a0878cdb25f 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043): android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: error code 8: attempt to write a readonly database 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteStatement.native_execute(Native Method) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteStatement.execute(SQLiteStatement.java:55) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.insertWithOnConflict(SQLiteDatabase.java:1549) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.insert(SQLiteDatabase.java:1410) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at org.openintents.safe.DBHelper.addPassword(DBHelper.java:742) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at org.openintents.safe.Passwords.putPassEntry(Passwords.java:419) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at org.openintents.safe.PassEdit.saveState(PassEdit.java:236) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at org.openintents.safe.PassEdit.savePassword(PassEdit.java:266) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at org.openintents.safe.PassEdit.onOptionsItemSelected(PassEdit.java:327) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.app.Activity.onMenuItemSelected(Activity.java:2195) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow.onMenuItemSelected(PhoneWindow.java:730) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at com.android.internal.view.menu.MenuItemImpl.invoke(MenuItemImpl.java:143) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at com.android.internal.view.menu.MenuBuilder.performItemAction(MenuBuilder.java:855) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at com.android.internal.view.menu.IconMenuView.invokeItem(IconMenuView.java:532) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at com.android.internal.view.menu.IconMenuItemView.performClick(IconMenuItemView.java:122) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.view.View$PerformClick.run(View.java:8816) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:587) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:92) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:123) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4627) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:521) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:868) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:626) 06-08 22:45:16.843: ERROR/Database(21043):     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)       ()                 Labels: Stack-Safe               Duplicated by filling up space in /data/data/  # cd /data/data/org.openintents.safe/databases # dd if=/dev/zero of=nothing bs=128k # dd if=/dev/zero of=nothing bs=128k nothing: write error: No space left on device                  Status: AcceptedOwner: rmceoin               Added checks in revision 2889.

282	Defect	Fixed	peli0...@googlemail.com	friedger	1276065813000	1276922937000	1276922937000	Scanned product toggles status when switching orientation	   1.scan a product, add to a list 2.rotate phone 3.product will be ticked off 4. rotate phone 3. product will be unticked    status of product should be unchanged.       Looks like the mExtraItems are not cleared.  If the scanned item is edited the product appears twice, once in the original form (as in mExtraItems) one in the edited form.        It only occurs if the shopping list is started from the plugin, if started from home screen, all works fine. Ergo, the intent action has to be changed after the items have been inserted to avoid duplicate insertion.        Fixed in r2711.
