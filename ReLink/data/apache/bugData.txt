ReadmeName README     HeaderName HEADER I expect to have either README or README.html for example to work this.   Instead none work and the only working file for this is: readme.txt or readme.htm (case sensitive still)  Apart from being undocumented (as far as I could see) it seems wrong to use non- internet standard extension .htm following in IIS's footsteps.  But Id also  expect any case to work but it doesnt, the addition of .txt (optionally) is  useful at least.  Nick	For whatever it is worth, this appears to work fine on Unix platforms.  I also would *not* expect readme.txt,readme.htm,readme.html variants to work.  But, that is my personal interpretation of the docs and my preference as well.  I'll leave this open in case it is determined that this is a Win32-specific thing. I know it works perfectly under UNIX, it IS a Win32 thing but surely that is  just as relevant.  Either to the docs or to the programming.  Ive not tested  this under Apache2 yet, but Im guessing you have due to upgrading its status -  if not I can if you wish?  IMO on Win32 the case shouldnt matter and extensions should be none .txt  and .html (not .htm).   --Nick The bug you describe applies to Apache 1.3.  It does not apply to 2.0.  However, if Multiviews is not on, automatic name 'prefixes' are no longer used on Apache 2.0.  With 2.0 you may need something as simple as  <Files 'README.*'>     Options +Multiviews </Files> <Files 'HEADER.*'>     Options +Multiviews </Files>  if you don't otherwise use Multiviews in the corresponding directory tree.    The fix is committed and will be available with the release of 1.3.28.  It does NOT work with 1.3.27 under Linux or BSD. I have confirmed this bug or one weth very similar behavior  on multiple installations running on multiple operating systems installed and tested by multiple people.  Please ignore my comments above. The issue I saw on Linux and BSD was a seperate issue  that at first appeared to have similar symptoms. 			Justin Erenkrantz	NickM	Ray Morris	Will Rowe

The server incorrectly expects a non-empty Host header even when the server is  specified by a numeric IP address e.g. 10.158.7.52.  The host header should be empty when the server IP address is specified using a  numerical address. Server incorrectly returns and 400 http server code.   rfc2616 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 Section 14.23 Host  IPv6 browsers will not work on Apache if this is not fixed.	Confirmed.  And this is a regression from 1.3, which handles this correctly.  However, I don't think it has anything to do with IPv6.  The same issue is present with ordinary old IPv4 addresses.  Although this should be fixed, I'm not sure why this is causing you a problem. All the browsers that I've seen send the IP address in the Host: header when they don't have a name, and this works fine. This should be resolved in revision 1.73 of server/vhost.c.  This will be included in the next release of Apache httpd-2.0.

Is it the  fact that the key is not getting substituted properly in the RewriteMap?  You obviously have problems with the per-dir prefix getting added more than once, but that is because you aren't using RewriteBase like you should be. Or alternatively, you should not place the RewriteRules inside a <Directory> section.

Please take a look at the line from rewrite log:   map lookup OK: map=AntiLeech key=$1 -> val= 1. back-reference to pattern does is not resolved to URI as it should be, when used within rewrite-map reference   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ ${AntiLeech:$1|/leech2.html} 2. rewrite map program does not receive any input, as it's evident from empty perl log, which I forgot to mention, and turned off buffering in attached perl script. 3. This bug is exposed only under Win32. Under UNIX RewriteMap works ok, all vars are subsituted, and per-dir prefix is added only once (latter may be because of slightly different directory layout, but that's another issue. BTW, RewriteBase does not help).   OK.  I'm not sure if prg: rewritemaps have ever worked in win32.  I'm updating the summary to better direct attention. May be will fixed in next version? ^) This bug is difficult to address in Apache 1.3.x.  Not impossible, but difficult.  As guessed, this has never worked in the 1.3 series.  Apache 2.0.x introduced new APIs for determining fully qualified path names.  Mod_rewrite in Apache 2.0 was updated in v. 1.84 to accept  any rooted path (based on the filesystem convention, e.g. c:/foo for  win32, or foo/bar:bleh for Netware.)  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/httpd-2.0/modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c.diff?r1=1.83&r2=1.84&diff_format=h  There may also be thread saftey problems with the rewrite cache, introduced in Apache 2.0's v. 1.83, that would need backporting.  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/httpd-2.0/modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c.diff?r1=1.82&r2=1.83&diff_format=h  Finally, it seems that ap_pstrcat is still being used to merge paths in 1.3 and 2.0.  This should be fixed in 2.0 to use apr_filepath_merge, and there was a similar API in 1.3.  So this can be fixed, but someone needs to take the time to write and test the fixes.  I'd entertain applying a patch that was well thought out.      Patch applied, this report will be resolved in 1.3.26.  Thread saftey of   the rewrite cache remains an issue, creating a new incident for tracking   thread saftey.    Make that, fixed in the forthcoming 1.3.25. *** Bug 8424 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I stepped into this bug, too.

Thanks.  Ranier.	This is a bogus warning.  Apache uses tmpnam in a safe way. Comment from Cliff Woolley (glad we have peer review ;-):  Actually, depending on how htpasswd is used, it might be possible to construct some sort of a symlink attack to have arbitrary files corrupted. It's not a bogus warning... it really should be fixed.  I've been meaning to do it for ages; htdigest was already fixed.  htpasswd is more difficult because the whole program needs to be APRized... there was a patch to do this at one point written by Mladen Turk, but the patch was overkill IMO (and that of the other people that reviewed it as I recall), so it never got committed.  If it were up to me, I'd leave this bug listed as open to remind us to get to this one day.  *** Bug 8197 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** htpasswd has been re-written, and no longer uses tempnam.

It's missing in both version 1.3.x and 2.0.x.  Firstly, the registration should appear inside the mime.types file:      application/xhtml+xml\t\txhtml xht  Secondly the DirectoryIndex directive inside httpd.conf (or all the http*.conf* files) should have a reference to 'index.xhtml', e.g.:      DirectoryIndex index.xhtml index.html  ... or perhaps:      DirectoryIndex index.xhtml index.html index.xhtml.var index.html.var  Many thanks,  Dave	*** Bug 7796 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Created an attachment (id=1542) Test XHTML file (index.xhtml)  I've added the type to mime.types, but I'm not going to change the default DirectoryIndex.

Still no fix for mpm=worker and likely other mpm's. Thanks for your patch!  I have committed a variant of your patch to HEAD.  Please try out a CVS snapshot or wait for the forthcoming Apache 2.0.36.  Thanks for using Apache! committed colm's patch that fixes suexec+userdir+cgid I am experiencing this problem on Solaris 8 and the latest version httpd 2.0.39.   Skimming through the source it seems the patches included in the bug report were applied before its release. It appears to be a problem with userdir, because apache will call suexec, but it does not recognize user directories (suexec is called with the target uid/gid of the httpd user/group and treats the CGI as if it were in the document root).    I have UserDir set to web in httpd.conf and am loading the following as DSOs:  access_module alias_module auth_module autoindex_module cgi_module dir_module env_module include_module log_config_module mime_magic_module mime_module negotiation_module setenvif_module suexec_module unique_id_module userdir_module vhost_alias_module  and the following compiled in:  # /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd -l Compiled in modules:   core.c   mod_ssl.c   prefork.c   http_core.c   mod_so.c  Hopefully I didn't miss something obvious!  Thanks in advance,  Dennis       Do you have any SuexecUserGroup Directives in your config files ?  Try removing them. Crossreference point: PR 9038 contains a discusion relevant to this issue. Without the SuexecUserGroup directive set, suexec is never called... nothing logged to cgi.log and CGIs (including ~user ones) are executed successfully as the httpd user. With the directive set, suexec is at least called, but it does not honor ~user... the target uid/gid are set to that of the httpd user and script execution fails because it is not in the document root.  I did check Bug 9038 before submitting, which states disabling cgid in the LoadModule should fix it.  I did this (noted in the modules I am loading) without success.  As I re-read 9038, Alex had success by disabling cgid at compile time.  Is that the ultimate fix (vs. at LoadModule time) ?  Thanks, Dennis  mod_cgid + userdir + suexec has been functional as of 2.0.39, I'm currently using that combination on several platforms.  Try reversing the order in which you load the userdir and suexec modules. Also, did you specify --enable-suexec at configure time? It's possible to have the suexec module built without that, so it may be an issue.  I did include that config option... pullled from config.log (minus the formatting for readability):  ./configure --with-layout=Apache / --prefix=/usr/local/apache / --enable-mods-shared=access actions alias asis auth auth_anon auth_dbm autoindex cache cern_meta cgi cgid charset_lite dav deflate dir env example expires ext_filter file_cache headers imap include info isapi log_config mime mime_magic negotiation proxy rewrite setenvif speling status suexec unique_id userdir usertrack vhost_alias / --enable-modules=ssl / --enable-so / --enable-ssl / --enable-suexec / --with-ssl=/opt / --enable-static-htpasswd / --disable-auth-digest / --with-suexec-caller=www / --with-suexec-docroot=/web / --with-suexec-userdir=web / --with-suexec-uidmin=10 / --with-suexec-gidmin=10 / --with-suexec-safepath=/usr/bin:/opt/bin  Any other ideas?  Your continued to help is appreciated.  Dennis Should have explicitly mentioned I did change the order in which suexec/userdir are loaded without success. It seems like this has been fixed at some point.  If not, please feel free to reopen the bug report.			Brian Pane	Colm	Dennis Kelly	Joshua Slive	Justin Erenkrantz

Please verify that the User and Group directives are valid for your system. These frequently have to be changed from the default (depending on the OS).  I think the failure is that Apache is trying to use an invalid user or group id when setting accessibility to the SysV semaphore used for accept serialization.  Alternatively, change from the default of using SysV semaphores to fcntl  locks by coding this in your config file:  AcceptMutex fcntl  Setting the User & Group to decent values (www:www) fixed it.The error message isn't really helpful, though. The error message has been changed to point the admin to the User and Group directives.  Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache! 			Jeff Trawick	Ralf Hildebrandt

The proxy cache is cutting the reply short if / is requested, but I get the full reply if /index.shtml is used. The same bug is under Windows 2000. This is seen on a bunch of different OSes, so change it to be All platforms and All OSes.  An email has been sent to dev@httpd.apache.org asking for people to look at this. There were lots of changes right before 2.0.35 regarding this code, so I think something may have snuck in.  If the filters were ordered right, the C-L should be correct, so this isn't obvious as to where the problem is and I'll let the people who worked on it pre-2.0.35 look at this since they were the last ones in the code. I cannot recreate this problem on Windows (haven't tried elsewhere).  Can  someone send me an httpd.conf (as simple as possible) that I can use to  recreate?

Compare http://www.murph.org/photos/ (Apache 1.3.22) to  http://www.murph.org:81/photos/ (Apache 2.0.35 with my patch from bug #7988).  I will attach the .htaccess for that directory (it's the same directory served  by both servers).	Created an attachment (id=1530) .htaccess from directory which exhibits this bug  This works for me on cvs-head (2.0.36-dev). Make sure that you have your AllowOverride config for the directory set to allow the .htaccess 'IndexOptioons' and 'AddDescription' directives to work. I'm still seeing the problem with 2.0.37-dev pulled from CVS yesterday (built  at Apr 30 2002 08:53:58).  See http://www.murph.org:84/test/ for a better example of the behaviour under  2.0.37-dev. Ports 81, 82, 83 have the same directory available under 1.3.22 (patched), 2.0.35(patched), 2.0.35(unpatched) for easy comparison.  'AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Indexes' is specified in httpd.conf  for the parent directory on all 4 servers. I just tested it with 'AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Indexes' and it works fine for me with 2.0.37-dev as of about noon today.  What system are you running on? Can you post the full container config for the directory in question?  Thanks. www.murph.org is running Solaris 8 4/01, patched with the Mar/28/2002 recommended patch cluster:  \tSunOS salsa 5.8 Generic_108528-14 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5  Built with gcc-2.95.2, as supplied on the Solaris 8 4/01 freeware companion CD.  Here is the config for the parent directory (which is the DocumentRoot):  <Directory '/usr/local/apache2/htdocs'>     Options Indexes IncludesNoExec FollowSymLinks MultiViews     AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Indexes     Order allow,deny     Allow from all </Directory>  Ah. Well I can confirm that it works on Linux. :)  I will have to bow out at this point. Someone with an appropriate Sun box needs to pursue this further. Can someone else with Solaris confirm this? AddDescription works fine for me with 2.0.36 and CVS. Solaris 8/sparc,  same patch cluster.

AddDescription 'New York City, NY' 'New York/'                                             ^  I can hit the problem easily.  Comparing 1.3 behavior with 2.0.44-dev behavior on Solaris 8:  With 1.3, if I omit a trailing slash from the directory name on AddDescription, the description is applied to the directory, but if I add a trailing slash to the directory name on AddDescription, the description is not applied to the directory.  Apache 2.0 is just the opposite.  ----  With Apache 2.0.44-dev on Linux I see the same results as with Apache  2.0.44-dev on Solaris -- when the directory name specified on AddDescription has a trailing slash, it works; otherwise it doesn't work.   A fix has just been committed to 2.0.44-dev.  Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache!  AddDescription is broken for directories again in 2.0.48.  I don't know if this is the root cause, but commenting out the one-line change made since 2.0.47 in mod_autoindex.c (line 1364) fixes this particular problem.  Yep, sorry. The previous fix wasn't 100 percent correct either. And the combination broke it finally ;).

I keep my  profile directory on a separate disk that is mounted under 'C:/Documents and Settings/Sam'.  However, the Sam/ folder does not appear in Apache's directory listing. Additionally, while the  directory listing is being generated, this appears in the error.log:  [Fri Apr 12 14:33:05  2002] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] symlink doesn't point to a file or directory: C:/Documents and  Settings/Sam  Asking for anything under 'http://localhost/C/Documents and  Settings/Sam' manually throws a 403 back to the client, with the same error in the event  log.  If I remove the 'FollowSymLinks' option for the directory then the error message is  instead:  [Fri Apr 12 14:41:29 2002] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Symbolic link not allowed:  C:/Documents and Settings/Sam  and a 403 is still returned to the browser.	Please don't submit to the bug database and post to the newsgroup at the same time.  You may reopen this report if you don't get a response within a few days on the newsgroup. Reopening, with more information:  Snippet from httpd.conf:    Alias /C 'C:/'    <Directory  'C:/'>       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews       AllowOverride None       Order  allow,deny       Allow from all    </Directory>  Requesting  http://localhost/C/Documents%20and%20Settings/ returns a listing of the directory, but  with the expected 'Sam/' entry (C:/Documents and Settings/Sam/ is actually a mount point)  omitted. Instead, '[error] [client 127.0.0.1] symlink doesn't point to a file or directory:  C:/Documents and Settings/Sam' appears in the error log.  Requesting  http://localhost/C/Documents%20and%20Settings/Sam/, or anything inside of it, returns a  403 error and likewise adds '[error] [client 127.0.0.1] symlink doesn't point to a file or  directory: C:/Documents and Settings/Sam' to the error log.  Requesting  http://localhost/C/Documents%20and%20Settings/All%20Users/ or any of the other links  from the directory listing works as it should.  After doing some reading, it appears that what  Apache calls symlinks on Windows are actually NTFS Junctions; most junctions have a target of  a regular pathname (such as 'C:/Target/'), but the mount point junctions Windows uses have a  target in the form of '//?/Volume{90b9a960-b928-11d5-bbf2-806d6172696f}/' (the classid is  the volume's unique identifier).  The error message suggests that Apache is checking the  junction target to see if it is a valid path (which the mount point junction target is not)  and throwing the error. So it seems the problem lies within the code that Apache uses to check the  symlink/juntion target.    This is fixed in the current 2.0.36-dev tree, and will be part of the   next 2.0.36 release we expect to roll out within a week or so.    Thanks for your report, your detailed examples, and for adopting Apache 2.0!   The precise behavior noted in the original bug still occurs in 2.0.44 on UNC  (remote share) paths under Win2K Server or Win2K3RC2:  Alias /nas/junction/dir1/dir2/ '//192.168.0.10/nas/junction/dir1/dir2/' <Directory '//192.168.0.10/nas/junction/dir1/dir2'>     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all </Directory>  [Thu Mar 27 22:24:03 2003] [error] [client 67.67.67.117]  Forbidden: //192.168.0.10/nas/junction doesn't point to a file or directory  If FollowSymLinks is turned off, then:  [Thu Mar 27 23:24:07 2003] [error] [client 67.67.67.117] Symbolic link not  allowed: //192.168.0.10/nas/junction  Either way, with indexing turned on and using the following mapping, Apache  browses the directory fine, and generates an index, but does not see ANY of  the junctions:  Alias /nas/ '//192.168.0.10/nas/' <Directory '//192.168.0.10/nas'>     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all </Directory>  It sees regular folders and files just fine.  NFTS can create at least two common types of junctions.  One is the MountVol  target format shown in Sam's bug report, and the other is a path reference as  created with 'linkd.exe' from Win2K Resource Kit.  The above behavior is  observed with BOTH types.    I have rated this as MAJOR because without fixing this, Apache cannot be used  to serve content from servers in a web farm that all work from a NAS server  that mounts many RAID arrays using the 'MountVol' or 'LinkD' method.  While  the LinkD method is uncommon, the MountVol method is offered in default  Windows GUI Drive Management on volume creation, and is a common way to add  new volumes into an existing path structure.      I'm not 100% this fixes the issue mentioned at  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8014 though I tried to  reproduce the issue as I understood it.  If one of the bug submitters could  test it that would be great.

I suppose the default-handler should be taught to recognize and fail httpd/unix-directory requests with a 404.  My only concern is that this is -not- a 404, that level of the heirarchy -is- found, but can't be processed in any meaningful way.  Implies a 401 or 403.  The processing schema's changed enough that you tickled this oversight. In fact, we are erroring out far more often (even in late 1.3.x builds) due to the possibility of one module being tricked into failure, and having another module pick up the request.  E.g. some folks used multiview matching on index documents, but those could (in some very bizare and tangled circumstances) be evaded, and autoindex was picking up the slack when the admin didn't intend for that to happen.  We now avoid Not Found as a 'catch all' if resources exist, otherwise such potentials will always exist.  Thanks for the report, and let us know about the gross hack! This has been fixed in CVS, and will be available in a later release.  The default_handler wasn't catching cases where all of the previous modules had declined to serve the request.

The bug is around line 2742 where  ap_select is called. It seems that the intention was to use the select command  as a precision sleep mechanism. As the comment indicates, some time needs to be  allowed for children processes to do their termination stuff. The problem was  that ap_select was returning prematurely as a result of a signal interupt  (errno = EINTR), and therefore was never really sleeping for the expected  amount of time. This didn't allow enough time for my children process to clean  themselves up and resulted in various resource leaks. I changed the line from:   ap_select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &tv);   to:   while(ap_select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &tv) == -1) {}   And while I am not saying that this code is the best way to do this, it did  work, allowing my children to die a natural death.	null

An example: http://zerospace.org:8080/zs10.JPG http://zerospace.org:8080/zs10.jpg	 This is the correct behavior.  All filename and uri parsing semantics are case sensitive on Unix, except where noted in the documentation.  Hmmm... Are you sure about this Will?  I haven't tried to see how this works in 1.3, but the docs for TypesConfig seem to imply that this is supposed to be case-insensitive.  (They aren't clear, but they use the term 'extension', which we almost always mean to be case-insensitive, and they say 'The extensions are lower-cased.'  I don't know what that is supposed to mean.  Joshua may be right ... if you can reproduce that .JPG worked in 1.3 please reopen this report and we can get the situation corrected. Yes it works in Apache 1.3.22  http://zerospace.org:80/zs10.JPG http://zerospace.org:80/zs10.jpg  Also adding JPG to the mime types does nothing.  Same mime config.

Here is what I did: placed an .htaccess file in my public_html directory containing only AcceptPathInfo On then requested the file http://www.apache.org/~slive/index.html/path_info which gives a 404 even though index.html exisists.

8388	null	CLOSED		Ching Wan	1019523720000	1037056228000		Long running CGI script cannot terminated by browser When a CGI script runs for a long time and the user clicks the 'Stop' or 'Back'  button in the browser before it ends, the server fails to terminate the CGI  process on the server, even if the CGI script is frequently writing back  lines.  Here's a sample partial CGI script:  $| = 1; print '<pre>/n': foreach (1 .. 50) {     print 'line $_/n';     sleep (1); }  This script continues to run even if the user has clicked 'Stop' in the browser  5 seconds into the process.  I remember fixing this problem in Apache 1.3 by closing the right process  handle.  But since 1.3 was not able to have unbuffered I/O to write back to the  HTTP server process immediately, the fix was not useful for 1.3 anyway.  Now  that 2.0 seems to be able to have unbuffered IO for CGI output (finally!),  fixing this bug would be extremely helpful, especially in defeating MS.  This  is a killer shortcoming of IIS where a run-away CGI script can never be  terminated except the pre-defined 'cut-off' time for all scripts.	I wonder if this is caused by the same thing as bug 8253 (r->connection->aborted not set)? [This is a mass bug update.] This bug reports a problem in an older version of Apache 2. Could you please update to the most recent version and see if you can reproduce this problem.  If the bug still exists, please update the bug with the latest version number.  If  the bug no longer exists, please close the bug report.  Sorry for this impersonal response, but we get many more bug reports than our volunteers can keep up with. Thanks for using Apache! With some fixes committed this morning to mod_cgi.c and server/protocol.c, the CGI script is normally terminated when using mod_cgi.  There may be some paths in mod_cgi that aren't fixed, and mod_cgid is definitely still broken.  I don't know why this bug is not being considered. I now try to post it as a Linux/Apache 2.0 bug, since it is to be found there too, in case that will draw more interest. I would think it is a major problem that Apache can not run cgi-scripts with keep-alive, and I would like our technical department to be able to upgrade our apache installations (for security fixes etc) without me having to patch it first. I am not sufficiently aware of the purpose of the problematic code to propose a final solution - in my own case, it is quite OK to just throw it out, but I would think it serves some purpose - perhaps to stop faulty cgi-scripts from running endlessly. Perhaps it could be specified in the configuration file whether this action is wanted or not. In general you can't assume that a PR is not being considered if there is no update in the last several days.  As already noted in the PR, it now works with mod_cgi with current code from CVS.  I am still working on getting it working with mod_cgid.  (I have it working in a patch posted to dev@httpd yesterday, but the patch needs  some further work before committing.)  I'm confused about your statement    'Apache can not run cgi-scripts with keep-alive'  What is the connection between keep-alive and this PR?  looks like bo@kase.se complained on the wrong PR by mistake...  ignore the last two updates :) A fix has just been committed to mod_cgid to terminate scripts which the connection drops.  Hopefully it will be in the next stable Apache 2 release (2.0.x).  The mod_cgi fixes will almost definitely be in the next stable Apache 2 release.   			Bengt 	Jeff Trawick	Joshua Slive

The  configure-script of php fails with  cannot open /usr/local/build/config_vars.mk: No such file or directory at  ./apxs line 248.  I tracked the error down to the apxs script. In line 69:  get_config_vars('$prefix/build/config_vars.mk',/%config_vars);  I am using the GNU layout. In this layout the build-directory is under  '/usr/local/share/apache2/build' and the prefix is '/usr/local/'  If I change that to the right path (/usr/local/share/apache2/build/' it works  and I can compile php. But when i try to make 'make install' I get the  following:  /usr/local/sbin/apxs -i -a -n php4 libphp4.la /usr/local/build/instdso.sh SH_LIBTOOL='/usr/local/build/libtool' libphp4.la  /usr/local/libexec sh: /usr/local/build/instdso.sh: No such file or directory apxs:Error: Command failed with rc=8323072  It seems thap apxs uses in the lines 418, 443 and 474 the wrong path-variable.  I think it should be the variable (or path) '$installbuilddir' from the file  config.layout  in case of '$prefix/build' ??? I do not know how to access that  variable or how I should do it right, because I am not so familiar with the  code-structurof apache.  I configured php with following command:  ./configure --with-tsrm-pthreads --with-mysql=/usr/local  --with-imap-ssl=/usr/local --with-gettext --with-imap=/Source/imap-2001a  --with-gd --with-openssl=/usr/local --with-apxs2=/usr/local/sbin/apxs  and apache 2.0.35 with the following:  ./configure --enable-layout=GNU  --enable-info --with-ssl=/usr/local  --enable-so	After a few tries, I changed all the $prefix/build to  /usr/local/share/apache2/build and compiled and installed php. This time the  installation was ok. The script copied libphp4.so to the right place and  inserted the LoadModuledirective in http.conf.  Now there is another error when I start apache:  Syntax error on line 218 of /usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf: Cannot load /usr/local/libexec/libphp4.so into server:  /usr/local/libexec/libphp4.so: undefined symbol: ssl_onceonlyinit sbin/apachectl start: httpd could not be started   I don't have time left for today but I think this is another problem  (hopefully). I will work on this tomorrow. Maybe there is another point in  somewhere.  *** Bug 8678 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I think that this was fixed in 2.0.36.  You can try a prelease version here: http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/  If that doesn't fix it, please reopen this report and up the version number.  Thanks for using Apache. I'm still seeing this in 2.0.36. In my case, apxs contained    my $prefix         = '/software/stow/apache-2.0.36';  and    get_config_vars('$prefix/build/config_vars.mk',/%config_vars);  when that second line should have been    get_config_vars('$prefix/share/apache/build/config_vars.mk',/%config_vars);  Also, apxs later contained    my $envvars = get_vars('bindir') . '/envvars';  which should have been    my $envvars = get_vars('sbindir') . '/envvars';  Those two changes allowed me to configure and build PHP 4.2.0.  I use a custom layout in config.layout, but it's very similar to the GNU layout; I can send along the details if they'd help. I spoke too soon: There are other instances of $prefix/build in apxs, As the original reporter mentioned, and they should all probably be fixed.  It doesn't look like this is fixed in CVS either (looking via ViewCVS at http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/support/apxs.in, which seems to be at version 1.37). I also ran into this, with an Apache build I did on a Debian system from  latest sources. I'm trying to build Subversion, and its configuration script  fails due to this bug. I've fixed support/apxs.in on my system, sort of. I've  just subscribed to the developers list so that I can discuss it there. In the  meantime, if someone's interested in the diffs, send me an email at  dmuller@spookydistance.com. A fix for this was just committed to CVS.  I'm pretty sure that it will be in 2.0.37 (or whatever version comes next).  Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache! 			Dan Muller	Jeff Trawick	Josh Smith	Joshua Slive	Stephan W

Under Apache 1.3.x this code runs without any problems.	I agree this looks like a bug.  But which version of 1.3 is this working with?  From  looking at the CVS history, it seems like 2.0's mod_include is almost identical to  1.3.25-dev's as far as parsing the expressions goes.  The parsing code in 2.0 was misplacing the character after the '443'... this was harmless if the character was whitespace, but bad if the character was a parenthesis.

8464	null	CLOSED		James Tait	1019652120000	1022642978000		mod_rewrite not executing external rewriting engine if args are supplied NOTE: This bug has been reproduced on Solaris 8 as well.  I have the following working config for Apache 1.3.24:  RewriteMap DAAC 'prg:/usr/j2se/bin/java -classpath /usr/apache/libexec/rewrite:/usr/apache/libexec/rewrite/jlog.jar DAAC 550 /var/apache/logs/daac_log' RewriteRule ^/Prot([^/]*)/(.+)     /${DAAC:Prot$1/$2|DENIED} [C] RewriteRule ^/DENIED$              - [F]  The config is simple enough, if the incoming request is for a file within a directory named, for example, /Protected, then the external rewrite engine gets called to perform authorisation (in reality there'd be an auth token or something in the URI).  However, transferring this configuration to 2.0.35 does not have the desired effect -- in fact, the external rewrite engine is never exec'd.  This has been tested with the above command line, a very basic shell script, a Perl script and a natively compiled binary -- none of them ever appear to get called (they should all touch a file in the filesystem when they are run, and do so when run from the command line).  The C program I used is as follows:  #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/time.h>  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {   char input[1024];   FILE *error_log;   struct timeval tv;   long delay;    if(argc < 2) {     printf('Usage: %s <millisecond delay>/n', argv[0]);     printf('Defaulting to 500ms/n');     delay = 500000;   } else {     delay = (atol(argv[1]) * 1000);   }   if (delay < 0) {     printf('Delay must be a positive integer/n');     return 1;   }    if((error_log = fopen('/tmp/DAAC.log', 'a')) == NULL) {     printf('Unable to open logfile/n');     return 2;   }    while (scanf('%1023s', input)) {     tv.tv_sec = 0;     tv.tv_usec = delay;     fprintf(error_log, '%s/n', input);     fflush(error_log);     select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &tv);     printf('%s/n', input);     fflush(stdout);   }   fclose(error_log);   return 0; }	Created an attachment (id=1814) Output of strace -f httpd -X  I've looked into this a bit further with 2.0.36, and also compared to 1.3.24.  In 1.3.24, mod_rewrite execl's a shell process itself in the function rewritemap_program_child(), passing the user-supplied config line as an argument:  execl(SHELL_PATH, SHELL_PATH, '-c', (char *)cmd, NULL);   This works, even if you supply arguments to the program to be run.  In 2.0.36 it leaves the exec to APR:      if (((rc = apr_procattr_create(&procattr, p)) != APR_SUCCESS) ||         ((rc = apr_procattr_io_set(procattr, APR_FULL_BLOCK,                                   APR_FULL_NONBLOCK,                                   APR_FULL_NONBLOCK)) != APR_SUCCESS) ||         ((rc = apr_procattr_dir_set(procattr,                                    ap_make_dirstr_parent(p, progname)))          != APR_SUCCESS) ||         ((rc = apr_procattr_cmdtype_set(procattr, APR_PROGRAM)) != APR_SUCCESS)) {         /* Something bad happened, give up and go away. */     }     else {         procnew = apr_pcalloc(p, sizeof(*procnew));         rc = apr_proc_create(procnew, progname, NULL, NULL, procattr, p);   This works when the program doesn't have arguments to be passed, but fails if there are arguments.  Looking at the apr_proc_create() function:          else if (attr->cmdtype == APR_PROGRAM) {             if (attr->detached) {                 apr_proc_detach(APR_PROC_DETACH_DAEMONIZE);             }              execve(progname, (char * const *)args, (char * const *)env);         }   NERK!  The whole user-supplied string is passed as progname, with args and env empty.  I can get around this by running a shell script that runs my program with arguments, but that's kinda messy.  I'd prefer to see mod_rewrite handle this correctly and pass in the args.  If I get time, I'll settle down and fix this.  If anyone wants to beat me to it.... I committed the revised patch you posted to dev@httpd, with one change, which  was that I had to disable the stat of the program to avoid having to duplicate  the apr_tokenize_to_argv() call.  If the program doesn't exist, it will fail to  startup anyway, so this should still be fine.  Thanks! Okay, so the apr_stat() thing wasn't *quite* that easy... apr_proc_create() does not necessarily return an error if the program specified doesn't exist...  on Unix, it only returns an error if the fork() call itself failed.  Bah.  So I  added another apr_stat() call just after the apr_tokenize_to_argv() call has already happened.  Anyway, consider it fixed.  :)			Cliff Woolley	James Tait

I compiled from the FreeBSD port, with mod_suexec.  OK, so just putting 'Userdir' without a folder to map to in httpd.conf is a  silly thing to do, but perhaps it's worth not letting apache start if that's the  case.	No denying that the behavior you describe is a bug, but let me just note for the record that UserDir with no argument is not correct.  What you want is UserDir disabled (Although I'm not sure if that will just pass through ~ requests, or if it will return 'forbiden'.  In the latter case, the only solution is to remove mod_userdir.) Yes, I know just putting 'Userdir' is a stupid thing to do: in fact, you get the  'take pages straight from ~userdir/' effect by never having a 'Userdir' line.  At least, that worked for me...  I just reckoned that if something eaily-spottable in the httpd.conf file could  make apache hang, it should be checked for before loading. Minor bug..... Wouldn't    userdir .  accomplish what you are trying to do?  In any case, Apache should provide more intellegent feedback. Re: 'Userdir .'  Fair point. It does work. In fact, leaving out the Userdir line altogether as I  previously suggested seems to make apache revert to its default of  public_html (hadn't *quite* tested things properly). Thanks for your  suggestion.  Sorry, it's the end of a long, hot day (am in the UK). Brain gone walkies. Leaving it blank doesn't cause a hang here - it doesn't do anything either.  However, so that people don't get any ideas on what this means, I have committed a change that makes UserDir with no arguments be invalid and rejected (with an appropriate message).  This fix is in modules/mappers/mod_userdir.c revision 1.44.  This will be included in the next release of Apache 2.0.  Thanks for using Apache!

It seems to be after 64K-128K of  data the remainder is corrupted when sent through to the requesting web  browser.  The data is clean FOR SURE when it is issued by the cgi.  Do you have a sample which exhibits the problem?  How is the data generated?   Slowly over time?  In one burst?  This nph- script works for me (all data  received by browser): #!/bin/sh  echo 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' echo 'Date: Thu Nov 29 16:22:33 CET 2001' echo 'Server: Apache' echo 'Connection: close' echo 'Content-Type: text/html' echo cat /home/trawick/apacheinst/manual/mod/mod_ssl.html cat /home/trawick/apacheinst/manual/mod/mod_ssl.html  well, i'm not using such a simple one. i'm using cgi-irc  (http://cgiirc.sourceforge.net). it's a chat skript, so the data is generated  slowly over time. anonther point maybe could be the multipart content-type:  #!/usr/bin/perl    print 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK/n';    print 'Cache-Control: no-cache/nExpires: -1/nPragma: no-cache/n';    print 'Content-type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=BOUNDARY/n/n';  still the same problem in version 2.0.36  still not working in 2.0.39  the problem, that the browsers gets only a certain amount of data, seems to  fixed, but now it looks like the connection isn't a keep-alive one.  as mentioned, the problem apears using the cgi-irc (cgiirc.sourceforge.net). while the browser still can send data to the server (which this cgi is handling  properly), the data which should be sent from the cgi, never reaches the  browser.  it's working on apache 1.3.19 .. but not on apache 2.0.39 if you wish to take a look:  http://www.galgenberg.net/cgi-bin/cgiirc/irc.cgi <-- apache 2.0.39  http://132.187.222.249/cgi-bin/cgiirc/irc.cgi <-- apache 1.3.19 Hi, i'm the author of CGI:IRC - thanks to zapp for pointing me at this bug.  I've now written a test-case that shows this working on apache 1.3 but not  apache 2.  It doesn't seem to be related to nph scripts, just anything sending content  that shouldn't be buffered.  The test makes use of javascript in the stream and for me works fine on apache  1.3 (two installs tested).  Apache 2: http://cgiirc.blitzed.org/teststream.cgi Apache 1.3: http://dgl.cx/test/teststream.cgi (Also nph- scripts at same locations as above to show it affects both nph and  non-nph scripts). Source code: http://cgiirc.sourceforge.net/files/teststream.cgi  Hope this helps. (Note that if the test fails but these values only differ by a second then it's  likely to be a laggy connection). On apache 2 they nearly all appear at the  same time. Also I know CGI:IRC has problems with opera and konqueror so don't  test on those browsers). And sourceforge appear broken for serving scripts so use  http://cgiirc.sourceforge.net/files/teststream.pl.txt and rename it.. Thanks for the recent updates.  Just to avoid wasting anybody's time:  this is an acknowledged problem that multiple developers have been able to reproduce  it is considered high-priority (tracked in STATUS file)  hopefully this will be resolved before long  Originally I said non-nph scripts had problems too, this doesn't seem to be the case and i've now got cgiirc.blitzed.org working on apache 2.0 by not using an nph script.  I think this problem might be related to bug number 8388? As The only thing remaining is the script doesn't always seem to be correctly killed by apache when the connection terminates, on apache 1.3 I'm quite sure it used to send a SIGINT (or similar) to the cgi script when the connection was closed, but apache 2 doesn't appear to be doing that?  We have a CGI script which works fine in 1.3.20 (and on the command line: 'su - nobody -c '/opt/bin/perl /blah/cgi-bin/dpradm page=18.html/&arg1=val1/&arg2=val2'') but never returns all the data to the browser (or telnet port80 session).  This is on Solaris 2.6.  As a result, it looks like our only Apache 2 box is going to roll back to 1.3.26. I believe that Apache 2.0.40 has fixed this bug for me. (only build difference being: --disable-threads). Bug still exists in 2.0.40  Agreed - bug still exists (but occurs less). I dont think this is limited to NPH either. [This is a mass bug update.] This bug reports a problem in an older version of Apache 2. Could you please update to the most recent version and see if you can reproduce this problem.  If the bug still exists, please update the bug with the latest version number.  If  the bug no longer exists, please close the bug report.  Sorry for this impersonal response, but we get many more bug reports than our volunteers can keep up with. Thanks for using Apache! sry guys, but it's still not working in 2.0.43 I haven't had chance to try apache 2 recently, but people are still reporting this and asking about it. Any chance of some sort of update about when it might be fixed?  Zapp, were you using mod_cgi or mod_cgid when you tried with 2.0.43?  2.0.43 has some fixes to help streaming in general (nph or not).  A problem specific to mod_cgid which broke streaming with wasn't fixed  until right after 2.0.43 was released.   hi trawick  LoadModule cgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgi.so  we're going to update to the latest CVS version this (maybe tomorrow)  afternoon. keep u informed!  any ideas, when v2.0.43++ will be released? If you were using mod_cgi with 2.0.43, you have all the fixes that are available.  Here is teststream.pl on cvs HEAD with mod_cgid:  --------- Testing streaming of content (with scripting) If most of the tests below succeed then it is likely streaming of content works fine. If they fail then either the webserver, a proxy between you and the webserver or your browser is having problems with streams (and sometimes scripts embedded inside streams). If the difference in any failed tests is only a second then it is more likely that your internet connection to the server is slow.

(data can be sent to (irc-)server, but  cannot be received)  2.0.44-dev: (httpd-2.0_20021024101256.tar.gz) client receives exact number of bytes, too. no waiting. CGI:IRC starts  immediately. BUT the client doesn't receive the all the data. the amount of  bytes, received by the client after CGI:IRC has connected to IRC-Server, is  changing from time to time; after a dozen tests, the data hasn't been fully  received one single time. the connection stays alive till termination (by user =) (same as above: data sending, not receiving...)  maybe david can provide some more details, what's going on that could terminate  the data-flow. I've just installed apache 2.0.43 to test with - using mod_cgi and prefork (default ./configure options).   teststream works fine -but- if it is called nph-teststream.cgi all but one of the tests fail (and it's out by much more than a second).  So, the first problem is fixed by renaming it something not beinging with nph- (I don't understand that - I thought the idea was to do less processing on nph- scripts). For CGI:IRC renaming nph-irc.cgi to something like irc-main.cgi and updating config (and removing the 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK' line on non-CVS versions) fixes it.   The other problem briefly mentioned above is still present, no signal is sent to the process to terminate it when the user stops the request, Apache 1.3 does, although I can't find this in any CGI specification, but it's a very useful feature. Thanks for the reminder about calling the script nph-...  Nothing written to the network in that case, so I'll start debugging that.  The nph flavor of teststream.pl works fine for me with this patch.  Wanna try the patch with the more complicated test (irc script)?

Under Apache 2.0, it  does not, it just tries ''. How do I get the old behaviour?	Is there any danger of this bug report ever being addressed?    Try using rewritelog and rewriteloglevel 9     http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritelog    to create a snapshot of the rewrite parsing of this request, and then   attach that to this bug.  Only then might we be able to determine what   mod_rewrite is doing (correctly or incorrectly.) Created an attachment (id=3792) RewriteLog file showing problem  OK I have attached a log file showing this, I'm not sure how it helps since it  doesn't really show anything not described in my original report, but here it  is ;-) It showed one -very- interesting thing, an empty URI.  The only way to get an empty URI is a file redirect (as opposed to a uri redirect.)  I'll ponder this and throw you more questions later.  Any 'interesting' (non-standard) modules loaded?  Any interesting things you've done in the corresponding <Location > or <Directory > blocks, or the core config? The configuration was completely standard. I downloaded a brand new copy of  apache 2.0.43 for this test. It was configured and installed with ./configure -- prefix=/tmp --enable-rewrite and the httpd.conf was unchanged from the  distribution except for changing the listen port, adding 'AllowOverride all' so  the .htaccess file would work, and adding the RewriteLog[Level] lines.  The htdocs directory was unchanged from the distribution except for adding a  trivial index.html file, creating a 'wt' directory under the htdocs directory,  creating an empty file 'wt/index.html.py', and creating a '.htaccess' file in  the htdocs directory whose contents were identical to that shown in the  original bug report. I've seen this problem, too, with 2.0.40 (RH Linux 8.0 distribution).  I checked an old copy  of 1.3.26 for comparison.  I made a simple rule for testing: RewriteRule ^index/.html$ rewritten.html  The internal redirects do not appear to be going through mod_rewrite.  See attachment  for a comparison of the rewrite_log between 2.0.40 and 1.3.26 Created an attachment (id=4024) rewrite_log comparison between 1.3.26 and 2.0.40  I also ran in to this problem when migrating from 1.3.27 to 2.0.40-11 (Red Hat 8 RPM). When ever / is requested (ie: http://www/example.com/ or http://www.example.com/foobar/) mod_rewrite doesn't resolve it to a DirectoryIndex file. This happens with REQUEST_FILENAME as well as SCRIPT_FILENAME.  RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f RewriteRule /* /cgi-bin/script.cgi [T=application/x-httpd-cgi,L] Created an attachment (id=4708) rewrite_log file illustrating the problem.  > RewriteEngine On  > RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f > RewriteRule /* /cgi-bin/script.cgi [T=application/x-httpd-cgi,L]  This cannot work. /* matches only slashes. You probably want something like /.*  The other problem (DirectoryIndex doesn't apply): IMHO, This is not a mod_rewrite bug. It seems, that we have more and more issues, comin' up with the new 2.0 internal_fast_redirect stuff, used, for example, by mod_dir. That means especially that there is no longer a real internal redirect from / to /index.html, so it cannot apply.  Jon, you may try RewriteCond %{LA-U:REQUEST_FILENAME} -f ...  Bug 13211 suffers from the same function (fast_redirect).  Either we have to document it, or we should change it back to a normal internal redirect (or spend some time in reworking and rethinking that fast_redirect function). Opinions? What does internal_fast_redirect exactly do/mean (since it is not documented, I  have to ask).  My personal opinion is that the rewrite-stuff should be better documented. I  use Apache (2) for quite a while now, but I simply cannot get certain rewrite- rules to work. Not because they aren't correct, but I always have problems  getting mod_rewrite to work at the right time (in comparison to other  directives). But I'm not sure if this related? the fast internal redirect doesn't do a real internal redirect (which would repeat most of the request handling for the new url) instead of only merging the data from a previous subrequest with the current request data at the point of calling. mod_dir uses that for redirecting / to /index.html (or whatever).  The relation to this bug is: in 1.3 mod_dir causes an internal redirect, which processes all the api phases again, so mod_rewrite gets a chance to match the new stuff. In 2.0 there's no redirect, so no chance for mod_rewrite (simple, eh? ;-)  Your rewrite problems... perhaps you should look in the bug database for similar bugs or create a new entry? I was wondering if there was any update for this bug report? I've been watching the version changelog and the status of this page, but haven't seen anything.  Thanks much! Please try the LA-U flag as already suggested.  I'm changing the component to docs, since the new behaviour simply needs to be documented. I wish I could Andr??, but LA-F doesn't work and LA-U returns strange results. I'm using Red Hat's build (httpd-2.0.40-11.3) so I don't know off hand if this would be an issue with the virgin distribution or not.  Is this really a 'feature' and not a bug in 2.x? Created an attachment (id=6393) rewrite_log file for LA-F/LA-U.  Boomer, you are absolutely right. I was convinced it worked for me sometime, but there was mod_negotiation involved...  However, mod_rewrite has a bug, that LA-U in directory context doesn't work. Just fixed it in HEAD (and proposed for backporting to the stable trees).  After fixing it, %{LA-U:REQUEST_URI) results in the actual delivered URI (e.g. /index.html) and %{LA-U:REQUEST_FILENAME} in the resulting /path/to/filename.  If you want to test it, the patch is here (the line numbers will differ for the 2.0 branch, but that shouldn't be a problem): <http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c.diff?r1=1.150&r2=1.151>.  (leaving in documentation category, because it's still new behaviour) In 2.1 it's fixed, since rewrite rules work also in subrequests there.  Unfortunately it's not likely to be backported, because it may lead to unexpected results in existing configurations.			Andr?? Malo	Derek Chee	Jon Ribbens	No Spam	Sander Holthaus	Will Rowe

When mod_proxy rewrites the header of a redirect, it uses the defined ServerName to accomplish this.  IMHO, this behaviour is incorrect if there are one or more ServerAliases and the request comes in via one of those aliases.  The proper behaviour, I believe, would be to have mod_proxy remember the Host: line for the original request and use that hostname (rather than ServerName) to rewrite the redirect.    So as not to break the current behaviour, perhaps an option could be added to selectively enable this correct behaviour?	Have you checked the effect of the usecanonicalname directive on this behavior?  'UseCanonicalName off' in the VirtualHost did give the expected behaviour.  Perhaps a note should go in the mod_proxy documentation to refer to the UseCanonicalName directive?  Thanks for pointing out the oversight. Accept this as a documentation bug.

Tried editing the changes in manually and  resulted in an assertion error in apr_hooks.c. Should I try it with a CVS snapshot or? Yes, you should try it with the CVS snapshot.  There was another ordering change with respect to mod_alias that went in a couple days ago, and without that change, you will get conflicts.  Sorry I didn't think of this before.  So you will either need to work from CVS and apply this patch, or work from 2.0.36 and apply the patches from bug 8841 before this one.  Let us know the results. Any luck with this patch?  It looks right to me, but I'm not going to commit it because I don't have a mod_vhost_alias setup to test it. *** Bug 10503 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** An updated version of this patch was committed.

Currently in mod_isapi.c, line 629, the null-terminating byte is not taken into account, so the value of 'lpdwSizeofBuffer' is too small by one.  This breaks ISAPI-dlls based on Borland Delphi 6.0, as these dlls use the value of 'lpdwSizeofBuffer' to determinate the length of the server variable.  Suggested fix: Replace line 629:  *lpdwSizeofBuffer = len; with *lpdwSizeofBuffer = len + 1;	   Fixed in CVS this morning... the fix will be available in .37 and an   interim test mod_isapi.so I will be making available this week that   will be build for .36.  Will let you know when that test version is   available [we have refactored the code significantly, and will want   to get it in as many hands as possible.

The system was under heavy load (10-18 child processes) with (intentionally) non-keepalive requests.  By adding traces I found that the dummy_signal_handler in worker.c  does get called 10 times for the correct thread,  but the function apr_proc_mutex_lock never returns.  I think this behaviour does not deserve a LOG_CRIT  which might unneccessarily alert the administrator as it can occur quite normally:  According to the man page for pthread_mutex_lock:  'If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting  for  a  mutex,  upon return from the signal handler the thread resumes wait-  ing for the mutex as if it was not interrupted.'  And for other lock types which do not behave the same way proc_mutex.c simulates this behaviour by making a loop over EINTR.  By the way, should proc_mutex.c set PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE if such is defined on the system? The man page says the behaviour is undefined for default.	Note: this PR is very similar though not identical to PR9169.   [This is a mass bug update.] This bug reports a problem in an older version of Apache 2. Could you please update to the most recent version and see if you can reproduce this problem.  If the bug still exists, please update the bug with the latest version number.  If  the bug no longer exists, please close the bug report.  Sorry for this impersonal response, but we get many more bug reports than our volunteers can keep up with. Thanks for using Apache!

Also having this problem on 2xP3-1.4GHz + Linux 2.4.20 + httpd 2.0.45 + openssl 0.9.7b + PHP 4.3.1, using  MPM worker (threadpool).

I'm probably misunderstanding this..  pthread_kill() and kill() both return 0 on  success; shouldn't this loop be in a success condition if it successfully kills the thread?  Isn't  that the point of the loop?  If I interpreted it correctly, then this loop will always trigger the  error unless pthread_kill() or kill() fails, no?                iter = 0;           while (iter < 10 &&   #ifdef HAVE_PTHREAD_KILL                  pthread_kill(*listener_os_thread, 0)   #else                  kill(ap_my_pid, 0)   #endif                  == 0) {               /* listener not dead yet */               apr_sleep(apr_time_make(0, 500000));               wakeup_listener();               ++iter;           }      \t if (iter >= 10) {              ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_CRIT, 0, ap_server_conf,                           'the listener thread didn't exit');          }         passing 0 as the signal to kill() or pthread_kill() is just a check to see if the process or thread is still alive  the purpose of that loop is to keep telling the listener thread to go away until either it goes away or we give up trying Severity of the message has been changed to debug in 2.1-dev, and change will be proposed for merge into 2.0.48-dev.

I was tracking this down last week, but I had to leave for WWDC and didn't follow up.  Your patch is right and has been committed in revision 1.4 of modules/filters/mod_deflate.c.  It will be included in the next release of Apache 2.0!  Thanks for using Apache (and keep the patches coming)! I am still seeing these symptoms in the httpd-2.0_20020530221254.tar.gz snapshot. The difference may be that for the files having problems the output is generated by a cgi script and then fed through INCLUDES and then DEFLATE. 50KB files work OK. 450KB files fail to be uncompressed using lynx 2.5-dev, Netscape 4.08 and IE 5.?. I am running this under linux 2.2.16 (Redhat) on a Athlon Tbird. I tested things a bit more and found that if I am just using the DEFLATE filter things work OK. But when I use DEFLATE after INCLUDES then they don't. I also tried just INCLUDES and the only differences were the expected ones. Is there any chance that you can provide a sample CGI script that  generates the right include tags to causes mod_include to create  a sequence of data that mod_deflate can't handle?  Thanks! A CGI-BIN script isn't needed to duplicate the problem. A sample broken link is at: http://wolff.to/area/test.html Source to the actual files is available at: http://wolff.to/area/test.txt http://wolff.to/area/sig.txt http://wolff.to/area/links.txt The .txt files are sym links to the .html files. INCLUDES and DEFLATE filters are run on .html files, but not on .txt files. Justin Erenkrantz committed a patch to mod_deflate earlier today that might  fix this problem.  Try out the CVS version of mod_deflate.c (rev 1.16) and see  if that fixes your problem.    Thanks!  I tried 1.16 in a CVS snapshot from a few days ago and the problem appears to be fixed.

For my docroot directory, I've got an 'AllowOverride All' in  place. However, in that root directory, I do *not* have an .htaccess file.  I get a Server Error 500, and it generates an access_log entry, but no  error_log entry.  access_log: 10.X.X.X - - [14/May/2002:11:40:20 -0500] 'GET /server-info HTTP/1.1' 500 630  If I remove the 'Satisfy any' clause, operation is normal. The issue is that I don't know in advance if the user will put a .htaccess file in place to pre-determine if I need to put a 'Satisfy any' clause in the LOCATION blocks.  I don't know if 'Satisfy any' requires an .htaccess file and a 'Require' clause  in it before it will work.  I think the behaviour should be that 'Satisfy any' doesn't care if there is  a .htaccess file or not (implies no condition, but not satisfied). Using  a 'Satisfy any' should always allow access if not specified by either  .htaccess or 'Allow from'  Michael.	Same behaviour with 1.3.26 on Windows 2000 Professional. (even with simpler test-case, i.e.  normal directory, only 'Satisfy') I wonder whether this should be split into two bugs: - one  documentation bug to make it clearer that access restrition by client host address AND  username/password ist _required_ if you want to use 'Satisfy'. (It only states 'is only  useful') - one bug, because Apache should log something like this in its error log.  Well, it's a broken logic in 'satisfy any' handling. Bug is fixed in 2.1.0-dev and proposed for backport.  Thanks for using Apache! It's fixed now and will be available in the next release (1.3.28).			Andr?? Malo	Psychopath

The given example is:  UserDir public_html /usr/web http://www.xyz.com/users  which says to search for ~username/public_html then /usr/web/ username and finally do a redirect to http://www.xyz.com/users/username.   However, this example does not work in Apache 2.0.36.  Imagine that we have 'real' users of aaa and bbb (that is, with a login/ homedir), a set of 'fake' users yyy and zzz with only a directory under /usr/ web, and a set of redirected users mmm and nnn.  Now, using the above  configuration, point a browser to http://host/~aaa and ~bbb - it works.   However ~yyy ~zzz ~mmm ~nnn do not work.  If you swap /usr/web and  public_html, now ~yyy and ~zzz work, yet ~mmm and ~nnn do not work.   Thus, there is no way to make all three alternates work on the same  system and no way to do preference of order of search either.  The solution is to change the 'return DECLINED' in the #if  APR_HAS_USER section of mod_user to a 'continue'.  The diff -u is:  --- mod_userdir.c.orig  Tue May 21 16:03:22 2002 +++ mod_userdir.c       Tue May 21 16:03:50 2002 @@ -330,10 +330,10 @@                  filename = apr_pstrcat(r->pool, homedir, '/', userdir,                          NULL);              }              else {                  -                return DECLINED;                  +                continue;                               }  #else -            return DECLINED; +            continue;  #endif          }  -----end-diff----  Currently, /usr/web or /web/*/html style UserDir entries will search for the  exact file for the username+dir and if it is not found, it move on to the next  entry on the UserDir line.  However, for the 'public_html' style UserDir entry, if we do not find  ~username/public_html then we decline to process this request and do  not go to the next entry on the UserDir line.  So, end of request, 404.  If we  change the 'return DECLINED' to 'continue' as above, then we can move on to the next UserDir entry.  Entries in the form of http:// are redirects and must come last.  Apache does not know if the user exists on the remote machine, thus it must come last on the line.  This fact should be mentioned in the docs and source.  Yet, the ability to even use alternates in not mentioned in the docs, only in the source.  This needs to be added too.

'/envvars';    should use 'sbindir' instead of 'bindir'.  Or perhaps replace the  get_vars() call with $CFG_SBINDIR.      There are a few other references to '$prefix/build' or variants.  They should be replaced with references to 'installbuilddir', or a  new variable $CFG_INSTALLBUILDDIR, defined in the same way as  $CFG_SBINDIR.  Don't forget this one:        include %PREFIX%/build/special.mk      If it was just a matter of changing the script I'd offer a patch,  but I'm an Apache novice and I don't have time to figure out how  to get the config_vars.mk path into the apxs script.  I'm just hacking  it in by hand.    Regards,                                            Jonathan Knispel    Just looking at building mod_webapp for Tomcat, it would be very  useful if they could 'apxs -q installbuilddir'.  The installbuilddir problem is a duplicate report (see 8453).  That problem is now fixed.  The sbin/envvars problem has been fixed for some time.  I'll change this to an enhancment request to track your suggestion to support 'apxs -q installbuilddir'.  fix the severity (now 'Enhancement') 'apxs -q installbuilddir' now works with the current code in CVS.

That is a custom multi-lingual error  message that comes distributed with the server.  See the ErrorDocument directives in httpd.conf for instructions on how to modify these.    Frankly, Josh, that's a bogus answer.  We distribute those error docs, not   some third party we can blame :-)    I believe we were looking at this issue, it may already be resolved in .37,   the question was whether we should be changing the SERVER_STRING variable or   adding another variable to be used by the error docs.  This may be a duplicate   report, as well, we need to tie out this report if that is the case.  Well, ServerSignature works as documented.  Personally, I don't see a need to provide two different ways to configure the sample errordocuments.  You can already simply go and edit the include file to get rid of the info that you don't want.  Or if that is too complicated, comment out those ErrorDocuments and use the internal ones.  The only way I see to get what you want is to add a SERVER_SIGNATURE environment variable and then go test for that in a bunch of places in the error docs.  It won't be that easy.   Just changing the SERVER_SOFTWARE variable won't be sufficient because there is also SERVER_NAME and SERVER_ADMIN used in various places that would be need to be controlled by ServerSignature to make things consistent. I have commented out the offending variable.  If users want to add it back, they can uncomment it.  Regardless, we shouldn't be including this information by default.

Often the first one or two lookups return no value (from rewritelog) and after that the returned values often seem to be offset by this amount with respect to request. Logs from the program indicate that it is returning the correct value based on the input it is receiving. I have seen this occur in several 2.0.37 snapshots, the latest being httpd-2.0_20020530221254.tar.gz .

You shouldn't have to check for APR_EAGAIN from apr_file_read()... it's only  getting returned because we told it to (by setting nonblocking mode).  Oops!    Please let me know if this fixes it and I'll commit the change.    --Cliff  I tested the suggestion to change the read to blocking and it seemed to work correctly.

9587	null	CLOSED		Timo Weing	1023133920000	1058275902000		Wrong icon with FancyIndexing If a directory contains a file listet in the DirectoryIndex directive, the  folder icon is replaced by the icon for the DirectoryIndex file,  e.g. /icons/layout.gif if there is a file named index.html.	Created an attachment (id=2021) Removes the filename mod_dir attaches to the request_rec before find_icon receives it.     An extra stat()?  (and in the wrong place, at that.)  ICK.    The essentials are that we already stat()ed this somewhere    in the way-back machine, and then ran it through to discover   that it is really something else [e.g. requesting /foo/ will   return an html document ... index.html in that directory.]   That means it is -more- than just another folder.    The correct fix is probably deeper in the code.  I expect we   will need to determine the stat() just a little bit earlier.   If I can prove the stat() always occurs, and that dir_walk   and file_walk will just borrow the pre-existing stat, then   noone should shoot us for requesting more detailed information   from apr_dir_read().    In any case, this should NOT BE OCCURING on Win32 unless some   patch to dir_walk, autoindex, or sub_req_lookup_dirent has it   borked.  Win32 apr_dir_read() already returns much more fileinfo   than most Unix platforms.    I will look at it, though I can't promise a fix in the 2.0.37   timeframe.  Certainly by 2.0.38.         The problem arises when mod_autoindex calls ap_sub_req_lookup_dirent on each of the sub directories.  The returned request_rec.filename has the DirectoryIndex file attached to it.  So, I figured it was best to strip that file off the end of the rr.filename before passing it to find_icon.  The ap_is_directory call is far from necessary... all that's needed is     rr->filename = ap_make_dirstr_parent (rr->pool, rr->filename);      'The problem arises when mod_autoindex calls ap_sub_req_lookup_dirent    on each of the sub directories.'    This is why the code once relied on dirent->type instead of rr->finfo->type.   However, some folks pointed out that Unix doesn't determine the filetype on   a dirread() call, and we would have to beg unix to do so.  However, if we   did that, we would want to prove we aren't wasting extra stats, and that   ap_sub_req_lookup_dirent will pass that info on to rr->finfo, which dir_walk   will actually consume.    If that code works correctly, it's just a matter of passing APR_FINFO_MIN   along with APR_FINFO_DIRENT switches to apr_dir_read.   i had to tweak the mod_autoindex.c in the latest version of apache to get it to work right.  here are my work arounds:           //if (!(p->icon = find_icon(d, rr, 1))) {                 // was getting wrong icons on folders                 p->icon = find_default_icon(d, '^^DIRECTORY^^');             //}             if (!(p->alt = find_alt(d, rr, 1))) {                 if (!(p->alt = find_default_alt(d, '^^DIRECTORY^^'))) {                     p->alt = 'DIR';                 }             }         }         else {             p->icon = find_icon(d, rr, 0);             p->alt = find_alt(d, rr, 0);             p->size = rr->finfo.size;         }           p->desc = find_desc(d, rr->filename);          if ((!p->desc) && (autoindex_opts & SCAN_HTML_TITLES)) {                 //added this check -- was getting garbage description on folder            if (dirent->filetype != APR_DIR)                   p->desc = apr_pstrdup(r->pool, find_title(rr));         } Commenting out 'if (!(p->icon = find_icon(d, rr, 1)))' breaks the ability to specify an icon for a directory with an AddIcon directive .

9673	null	CLOSED		Christian Kohlsch	1023391320000	1045439339000		Conditional GET requests not handled properly with filtered content Apache2 does not pay attention to dynamic PHP scripts configured by   SetInputFilter/SetOutputFilter PHP, as it still checks the modification   date of the plain .php file.      This leads to caching problems, when the user's browser sends a   'If-Last-Modified' request. Apache returns '304 Not Modified', as the  PHP file itself has not changed, although the dynamic content may have  changed!    The problem is in modules/http/http_protocol.c, line 386+  Hotfix: I have commented out line 393 (return HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED), so that this  feature is totally disabled.    Is there a chance to check for an Input/OutputFilter set? That way, we could  deactivate the feature for PHP pages only.	I'm fairly sure that it is the filter itself that should be removing the last-modified.  There are many filters that do not affect caching, so apache should not be removing last-modified for every filter.  So, the punch line is, you should file this bug report with PHP. The problem is that the PHP filter is not called. Here is a dump of the  client-server communication:    ---------> from Client to Server  GET / HTTP/1.1  Accept: */*  If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Jun 2002 17:47:44 GMT; length=17947  Host: www.newsclub.de  Connection: Keep-Alive    <-------- Reply from Server to Client    HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified  Date: Thu, 06 Jun 2002 17:50:08 GMT  Server: Apache/2.0.36 (Unix) DAV/2 PHP/4.2.1  Connection: Keep-Alive  Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100  ETag: '66ab2-4ef-63a14340'    --------- End of reply, that's it - no content!    So, there is neither PHP output nor the PHP source code at all, Apache seems  to block further processing of the request.    Still a PHP problem.  Content is never returned on a 304 response.  That is the point of the response. What is happening is that Apache is running the request, seeing the  last-modified information, and deciding that the client already has up-to-date content, so it doesn't need to send it again.  It is the responsibility of the PHP filter to remove the last-modified information so that apache always serves fresh content.  Oops.  I take it all back.  I just tried with mod_include's INCLUDES filter, and even though it strips Last-Modified, Apache still serves conditional GET requests.  Ouch.  Here's an example: ab26[joshua]59% telnet httpd.apache.org 80 Trying 63.251.56.142... Connected to httpd.apache.org. Escape character is '^]'. GET /docs/vhosts/index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: httpd.apache.org If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Jun 2002 20:58:16 GMT  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified Date: Thu, 06 Jun 2002 21:01:29 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.37-dev (Unix) ETag: 'ea72a-b3f-f3b22680;2434f440' Content-Location: index.html.en Vary: negotiate,accept-language,accept-charset   And what the heck is that ETag doing in the 304 response?  It is not in there for a normal response: HEAD /docs/vhosts/index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: httpd.apache.org  HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 06 Jun 2002 21:09:12 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.37-dev (Unix) Content-Location: index.html.en Vary: negotiate,accept-language,accept-charset TCN: choice Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 3158 Content-Type: text/html Content-Language: en  And what the heck is the Content-Length doing in the normal response?  Both Content-Length and ETags are explicitly unset by mod_include.  I'm afraid I'm out of my league here, so I'll need to leave this to others. The If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since logic uses r->mtime as the time of the entity being served, not the Last-Modified header.  I assume this is an optimization to avoid reparsing Last-Modified.  So either stripping Last-Modified is not enough (also set r->mtime to 0), or we need to change the logic on line 316 of http_protocol.c.  Note though that this is also how Apache 1.3 deals with it, so I'm not sure I see what the problem is.  Sounds like a bug (misunderstanding?) in mod_include and mod_php4.  --Cliff  The Content-Length is probably being generated by the content length filter  (that's its job).  Not sure about the etag, but I do remember some discussion  about that recently I think...  As I understand, the problem is the filter concept itself.     Filters are applied on data that is already processed by http_protocol.c          What http_protocol.c checks is the modification time of a file, ie.     'index.php'. The script has been written in 2001, for example, but it produces     new content from a database every minute.          So, the PHP code gets only executed, if Apache decides to pass the data to the     filter. Here Apache decides not to, because it thinks that the file has not     changed.          The ETag is probably generated because Apache looks at the program code of     index.php itself, not at the content the PHP script produces.         I suggest to add an Apache directive to disable If-Modified-Since processing    for Filtered files, for example:        <FilesMatch '/.php$'>        SetInputFilter PHP        SetOutputFilter PHP        CheckIfModifiedSince off    </FilesMatch>        PHP itself could then automatically set this directive.       I disagree.  It should be the filter's responsibility to decide if it modifies the data, not the administrator.  If the filter wants to deligate that job to the administrator (like mod_include does with XBitHack full) then it can do so. But somehow, http_protocol.c must get that information.    Is there a way to check for a certain filter in http_protocol.c?  That would enable me to write a quick hack for PHP.    Currently, I have disabled 'not modified' replies at all, which is  no good idea...    This is due to a bug in PHP and in the httpd-2.0 core.  default_handler shouldn't be calling ap_meets_condition().  As I posted to dev@httpd, this decision should most likely be delayed until the ap_http_header_filter() is called.  However, PHP's use of filters is completely and totally broken in many ways.  =)  First off, it doesn't unset Last-Modified which it needs to do.  There's a lot of bogosity in how it deals with buckets.  I've posted before to php-dev@ about this. Can someone give me a hint how to write a quick fix for it?  I would just need to check if PHP is in the filter chain.    That's easier said than done.  Easier is the seemingly 'right' fix that Justin  proposed: move the ap_meets_conditions() call from the default_handler to the  ap_http_header_filter.    --Cliff   I'd like to post a workaround without patching apache or PHP....  Just edit your script(s) to send a 'header('Last-Modified: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT');' or just some other date older than the mdate of your script file. This solves the problem.  Reason: The bug causes Apache2 to look for the mdate of the .php file to determine if it has been modified. If the browser first gets a header like above, it next time asks for the page with an 'If-Modified-Since: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT'. Then, the httpd looks at the mdate of your script, which is always newer and says: Yes, it has been modified, '200 OK'. The script will be served and it will response again with the header line from above. Round and round the story goes. :))  Greets, and have fun!  Daniel Daniel: Your workaround solves the problem, but creates another one.  Searching engines that spider the pages would see 'old' Last-Modified headers  and therefore will not index them.    At NewsClub.de, the pages are updated at least every 30 minutes, so this  fix is at least not good for me.    Maybe the bug is even fixed in the current CVS versions of apache2 and php4?    Hmm, the actual Changelog contains:    *) Add a filter_init parameter to the filter registration functions      so that a filter can execute arbitrary code before the handlers      are invoked.  This resolves a problem where mod_include requests      would incorrectly return a 304.  [Justin Erenkrantz]  Is this the solution to our problem? I'm compiling httpd-2.0_20020723101312 at the moment and will try it. I'm sorry, problem not solved yet using the latest unstable cvs code of both  php4 and httpd-2.0.  ...but they are compiling and running fine :)))) This should be fixed in Apache 2.0.42 and later.  Unknown when exact fix was committed (probably much earlier than 2.0.42), but the behavior works as expected for filtered content now. I'm still having this bug, even with the 'short fix' Daniel Eckl posted. :-/  Running Apache 2.0.43 for Windows with php-4.2.3-Win32. Try PHP 4.3.0 BETA, it seems to be working now. This bug has been closed but appears to still persist.  I'm running Apache  2.0.43 with PHP 4.3 and I still have this issue.  Has it been decided wether  this is legitimately a bug in Apache or PHP yet?  I have heard it thrown around  as a PHP bug by Apache and an Apache bug by PHP and was wondering if either  side has given in and said where the bug really is.  Thank you, Steve The problem can be worked around in php.  See http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=17098  Daniel Yes, the filter_init hook resolved this.  See how mod_include and mod_php (in their CVS tree) do it.  It should be included in the next PHP release if it isn't already, but there isn't anything more we can do with this issue.  The API is there.  Thanks for using Apache HTTP Server!			Christian Kohlsch	Cliff Woolley	Daniel Eckl	Erlend Stromsvik	Joshua Slive	Justin Erenkrantz	Sascha Kulawik	stephen fox

10147	null	CLOSED		Christoph Vogel	1024753320000	1025121675000		Broken ExtFilterOptions DebugLevel Actually I tried to find out how to escape ExtFilterDefine commands correctly.  I defined  ExtFilterDefine sed-replace cmd='/bin/sed s/verdana/arial/g'  as an example (the actual problem was that cmd='/bin/sed 's/verdana/arial/g''  doesn't work). This external filter works okay with Set/AddOutputFilter. To debug the command I added  ExtFilterOptions DebugLevel=9  to the corresponding <Directory> context. But then the ExtFilter stops working  and gives me  [error] couldn't find definition of filter 'sed-replace'  in my error_log and a related error is given back to UA. Nothing else has been  changed after adding the ExtFilterOptions directive.	I wasn't able to reproduce the lost filter definition when using this configuration:  <Directory /photo> DirectoryIndex index.cgi Options Indexes ExecCGI AddHandler cgi-script .cgi  SetOutputFilter sed-replace ExtFilterOptions DebugLevel=9 </Directory>  ExtFilterDefine sed-replace cmd='/bin/sed 's/photos/picurs/g''  (I didn't see any output at the client because sed got confused by the single quotes.  When I remove the single quotes it works fine.)  Can you spot something about my testcase which is inconsistent with your description, or can you perhaps supply a set of minimal changes to the default httpd-std.conf which would expose the problem?  Thanks so much!  (Certainly I need to update the doc to describe quoting issues like this!!)  I did it the other way 'round and tried to reproduce your situation :) It does work if the ExtFilterDefine and the ExtFilterOptions statement are  located _within the same VH_. In my configuration ExtFilterDefine is located in the main config (so I can  reuse it otherwhere) and ExtFilterOptions + SetOutputFilter in a directory  context within a VH. Contrarily the ExtFilter works fine in this situation if  ExtFilterOptions is not set. So the bahaviour is inconsistent and I think one  should have the possibility to split Define and Options for ExtFilter just like  I did. Apart from that - wouldn't it be nice to have a separate logfile for ExtFilters  just like with CGIs oder URL rewriting? I dunno if it's a enough for a formal  feature request. Thanks for the update...  I was able to reproduce and am working on a change to mod_ext_filter so that filter definitions can be used across multiple servers/vhosts.  (I'm ignoring your feature request for the moment :) )  Thanks again!  mod_ext_filter has been changed to find filter definitions in the main server in case they weren't defined in the vhost...  the patch as committed is below, and will be in the next release of Apache:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd- 2.0/modules/experimental/mod_ext_filter.c.diff?r1=1.29&r2=1.30  I tweaked the documentation to try to clarify how parameters to the external program are specified.  In addition, I added a new example which you might recognize.  If you really want to have stderr from the filter written to a file, please write another PR for the feature request.  I don't personally plan on doing anything about that unless it is clear that there is a widespread desire for it.  (Other folks may be interested however.) Note that the LogStderr option (on the ExtFilterOptions directive) can  be used to capture the external filter's stderr in the Apache error log.  Thanks again for your report!

This also assures that if the ISAPI module wants   to return the 200, or 500, or redirect, and completely handles it internally,   that this bug won't appear again.			Jiri Novak	Will Rowe

This confuses some browsers when they try to use the META tags in the target document.	It is supposed to have a charset param when not using custom errordocuments beca use we output a response body with HTML in it, and we are specifying what charse t that response body has.  This is not a 'default' charset, it is the charset th at we wrote the document in.  Since the generated page uses ISO-8859-1 the charset parameter is allowed but  not required on the redirect response. Removing the charset attribute will have  no effect on compliant browsers, and resolve the issue for non-compliant  browsers. The current Apache behaviour is correct but breaks some older versions of  Netscape. I suggest code be added to enable a BrowserMatch directive to  selectively disable adding the charset (specifically on redirects?). The suppress-error-charset variable is now available for this purpose.			Bill Stoddard	Joshua Slive	Klaus Johannes Rusch	marcs@znep.com

Baxter	1025719560000	1045690988000		suexec allows environment variables not in the safe list Due to the way suexec checks environment variables in the environment against the compiled-in safe list to decide if variables should be allowed through to the executed CGI program, environment varibles *not* explicitly defined in the safe list are allowed through if the beginning of the variable name matches a variable in the safe list.  This may be by design, in which case the suexec documentation should be amended appropriately.  I cannot see how this could ever be a security problem.  The 'problem' appears in both the 1.3.26 and the 2.0.39 versions of suexec.c, and I have verified it at runtime in Apache 1.3.26.  The problematic code appears in apache_1.3.26/src/support/suexec.c, function clean_env():  static void clean_env(void) {     char pathbuf[512];     char **cleanenv;     char **ep;     int cidx = 0;     int idx;       if ((cleanenv = (char **) calloc(AP_ENVBUF, sizeof(char *))) == NULL) {         log_err('emerg: failed to malloc memory for environment/n');         exit(120);     }      sprintf(pathbuf, 'PATH=%s', SAFE_PATH);     cleanenv[cidx] = strdup(pathbuf);     cidx++;      for (ep = environ; *ep && cidx < AP_ENVBUF-1; ep++) {         if (!strncmp(*ep, 'HTTP_', 5)) {             cleanenv[cidx] = *ep;             cidx++;         }         else {             for (idx = 0; safe_env_lst[idx]; idx++) {                 if (!strncmp(*ep, safe_env_lst[idx],                              strlen(safe_env_lst[idx]))) {                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                      ! note only checked to length safe_env_lst[idx] variable!                     cleanenv[cidx] = *ep;                     cidx++;                     break;                 }             }         }     }      cleanenv[cidx] = NULL;      environ = cleanenv; }  I suppose one way of fixing this to do exact comparisions would be (avoiding calling strlen() on an 'untrusted' environment variable):              for (idx = 0; safe_env_lst[idx]; idx++) {                 if (!strncmp(*ep, safe_env_lst[idx],                              strlen(safe_env_lst[idx])                      && *ep[strlen(safe_env_lst[idx])]=='/0')) {                     cleanenv[cidx] = *ep;                     cidx++;                     break;                 }             }  Alternatively this could just be described as a feature, in which case this paragraph in htdocs/manual/suexec.html.html should be amended appropriately:        <li>         <strong>Can we successfully clean the process environment         to ensure safe operations?</strong>           <blockquote>           suEXEC cleans the process' environment by establishing a           safe execution PATH (defined during configuration), as           well as only passing through those variables whose names           are listed in the safe environment list (also created           during configuration).         </blockquote>       </li>	hmm, shouldn't one check for a '=' sign?  (or alternatively append a '=' to the variable names within the 'safe' list?) Options? I guess it could be fixed with just a quick strlen comparison.  But note that this is probably not a security risk.  The point of cleaning down the environment is to prevent unsafe env variables from being passed (think LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc).  It is HIGHLY unlikely that an attacker would be able to construct an unsafe env variable using a prefix of a safe env variable. strlen doesn't work here, because the env array consists of enties ala 'PATH=/foo/bar'.  But you're right, it's not really a security risk. But I'm pedantic ;-)) I found, however, <http://bugs.apache.org/index.cgi/full/2790> and I think, most of the stuff suggested there is worth to be patched. (the current problem is also described there - with the same solution, I proposed here 5 years later ;-) Well, it's fixed in 2.1 and proposed for backport.  Thanks for the report and thanks for using Apache! The fix will appear in 1.3.28 and 2.0.45.			Andr?? Malo	Joshua Slive

It does report the correct status in the administrator account, which was used to install the Apache2 service.  In the superuser accounts, the 'Stop' button is grayed out, and the 'Start' button doesn't do anything.  'net stop apache2' and 'net start apache2' work fine from the command line in the superuser accounts, but have no effect on the Server Monitor status.	   I believe we have addressed this in Apache 2.0.40 - please upgrade   and check out the new behavior.  There were several bogus permission   assumptions that -have- been fixed. Done and done.

10575	null	CLOSED		Phil Almquist	1026178320000	1089427557000		no option to autoindex auth protected files/folders nt	To be a bit more verbose -   mod_autoindex hides directories and files that require authentication, which leads to a catch-22; how does someone find the file to log in if they can't see that it exists?  It's very nifty that it can hide authentiated resources *if* the site requires users to log in earlier; however, this doesn't work in all situations.  Therefore, it's necessary to have an option where this behaviour is turned off.  [changing the severity, as this isn't an enhancement; it's a bug in a 2.0 enhancement ] I know It's silly to argue over the serverity level, but this was a deliberate design decision,  and hence can't be classified as a bug.  It was considered unsafe to give un-authenticated users information on areas of the server to which they don't have access.  Yes, it would be nice to be able to turn this off.  But it's not a bug. wow i forgot this bug report even existed since ive stopped using autoindex (due to this problem actually).  this might only be an enhancement but it is very necessary for doing seemingly simple things like indexing userdirs and forces the user to create their own custom cgi or similar autoindex which is not at all an ideal solution.  other than requiring auth in the root directory which is not an option there is currently no possible way to have a completely autoindexed site that uses any sort of authentication.  with the new header / footer options and other enhancements mod_autoindex is becoming much more useable and more integrated in websites structures; it would be very nice if it wasnt incompatable with authentication.  i had to tweak the mod_autoindex.c in the latest version of apache to get it to work right.  here are my work-arounds:           //if (!(p->icon = find_icon(d, rr, 1))) {                 // was getting wrong icons on folders                 p->icon = find_default_icon(d, '^^DIRECTORY^^');             //}             if (!(p->alt = find_alt(d, rr, 1))) {                 if (!(p->alt = find_default_alt(d, '^^DIRECTORY^^'))) {                     p->alt = 'DIR';                 }             }         }         else {             p->icon = find_icon(d, rr, 0);             p->alt = find_alt(d, rr, 0);             p->size = rr->finfo.size;         }           p->desc = find_desc(d, rr->filename);          if ((!p->desc) && (autoindex_opts & SCAN_HTML_TITLES)) {                 //added this check -- was getting garbage description on folder            if (dirent->filetype != APR_DIR)                   p->desc = apr_pstrdup(r->pool, find_title(rr));         }  This patch doesn't solve the problem of hiding directories with authenticated access does it? Is there any patch which does this work? Or any other workaround? I need it very much...  Thanks, Martin Created an attachment (id=11165) Finally I found a workaround - this dirty hack disables directory hiding feature.  Can this feature be brought back?  Perhaps be default, auth protected dirs files can be hidden, but allow to specify to display hidden directories and files with IndexOptions?   Incoming Patch adds a new IndexOptions Command 'ShowForbidden'.  This will list directories or files that normaly wouldn't be shown because the subrequest returns  forbidden.  This patch is against 2.1-CVS Head. Created an attachment (id=11890) Adds 'ShowForbidden' to IndexOptions  Oooh, nice, +1.  Watch the code style though:  +    if((autoindex_opts & SHOW_FORBIDDEN) &&  +       (rr->status == HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED || rr->status == HTTP_FORBIDDEN)) {  should be:     if ((blah)        && (blee)) {  (I also detest the (1 == foo) style rather than (foo == 1) but that's not in the style guide :) Patch Commited to 2.1.

10617	null	CLOSED		Arthur P. Smith	1026253200000	1026302387000		SegFault in mod_ext_filter when content_type is null This happens when a filtered URL returns a Location: redirect (the example I looked at was the Zope management console) - the bucket-brigade for the (non-existant) body is forwarded to the external filter, but no content_type is set (and there is no content). You obviously don't want to filter a content-less body. The following is a patch to mod_ext_filter.c that fixes the problem:  *** mod_ext_filter.c    Tue Jul  9 18:01:47 2002 --- mod_ext_filter.c_orig       Tue Jul  9 17:57:05 2002 *************** *** 491,499 ****           return APR_EINVAL;       }       ctx->p = f->r->pool; !     if ((f->r->content_type == NULL) || !       (ctx->filter->intype && ctx->filter->intype != INTYPE_ALL && !         strcasecmp(ctx->filter->intype, f->r->content_type))) {           /* wrong IMT for us; don't mess with the output */           ctx->noop = 1;       } --- 491,499 ----           return APR_EINVAL;       }       ctx->p = f->r->pool; !     if (ctx->filter->intype && !         ctx->filter->intype != INTYPE_ALL && !         strcasecmp(ctx->filter->intype, f->r->content_type)) {           /* wrong IMT for us; don't mess with the output */           ctx->noop = 1;       }	Note this was for a location also serviced by mod_proxy - I haven't tried it for CGI or other ways you could get a Location: directive returned, so it could be really a problem in mod_proxy. I'd suspect mod_ext_filter though first. mod_ext_filter definitely needs to watch out for NULL content_type. At the very least, the if statement should be changed to:       if (ctx->filter->intype &&          ctx->filter->intype != INTYPE_ALL &&          (!f->r->content_type ||           strcasecmp(ctx->filter->intype, f->r->content_type))) {  So if the user specifies a certain content_type to process we'll make certain that there is a content_type associated with the response. I do not know whether or not a NULL content_type always implies that there  is no actual response body.  I doubt that it is true in general.    mod_ext_filter should already handle an empty response okay (or that is another  bug :) ), so the fix above should be sufficient for your problem and we don't worry about whether or not there is a response body to filter.  Good point - your fix is definitely the right one. Thanks! The fix has been committed and will be in the next release of Apache.  Thanks for your report/patch, and thanks for using Apache!

This change will be in the next release of Apache 2.0.x.  For now, the SDBM dbm flavor is always used.  It won't be compatible with dbm rewrite maps built for Apache 1.3 until apr-util supports ndbm and mod_rewrite is changed to prefer ndbm over the built-in sdbm.   Someone has expressed to work on ndbm support soon, so  hopefully that change will be in the next Apache 2.0.x release too.  The PR should be kept open until the ndbm support is available.

10678	null	CLOSED		Thomas K	1026380700000	1058217047000		Several .htaccess files are consulted, REMOTE_USER gets dropped Hello,  I am using Apache 2.0.39, but unfortunately the REMOTE_USER environment  variable gets lost, when limiting access by means of .htaccess. In  contrast to this it is possible to limit the access in the httpd.conf file.  works:   Virtual Host Config:     <Location /dir>         AuthType Basic         AuthName Test         AuthUserFile /path/to/file         Require valid-user     </Location>  doesn't work:   .htaccess:         AuthType Basic         AuthName Test         AuthUserFile /path/to/file         Require valid-user  Is there a special reason, why the REMOTE_USER variable is dropped in the second case and how can I avoid this behaviour? When trying to access a Document in '/dir' one is asked for password as usual, but even a simple Shell-script just writing the environment to a file, does not show the REMOTE_USER variable. The script was configured using AddHandler and Action.  AddHandler testhandler .test Action testhandler /cgi-bin/testscript  'testscript' contains:  #!/bin/sh echo -e 'Content-Type: text/plain/n/nhello world/n'; set > /tmp/testscript-output  Thanks in advance!  Ciao, Thomas	It works with Apache 1.3.26 so it's not an usage problem. .htaccess isn't the problem.  It seems more to be in the use of AddHandler and  Action.  If a similar simple script exists in the directory and is executable under the  ExecCGI rules, then REMOTE_USER is passed: .htaccess:     AuthType Basic     AuthName Test     AuthUserFile /path/to/password/file      Require valid user (or Require user name)  Then a script in that directory like this shows the environment variable:  test.cgi: #!/bin/sh echo 'Content-Type: text/plain' echo echo 'Remote User: $REMOTE_USER'  However, identifying such a script in an Action or Script directive causes the  variable to be lost somewhere, as in this as well as the case originally  outlined:  httpd.conf: Script PUT /path/to/the/above/script  .htaccess:    AuthType Basic    AuthName 'no REMOTE_USER'    AuthUserFile /path/to/password/file     <Limit PUT>       Require user name    </Limit>  and the variable REMOTE_USER does not appear.     A further interesting effect occurs when using two .htaccess files.  1.)  htdocs/.htaccess: AuthType Basic AuthName Test AuthUserFile /home/test/htdocs/.htpasswd Require user b AddHandler test-script .sh Action  test-script /cgi-bin/test.cgi  cgi-bin/.htaccess: #empty  When trying to access a document test.sh. The server asks for user b's  password, but the REMOTE_USER variable doesn't exist.   2.)  htdocs/.htaccess: AddHandler test-script .sh Action  test-script /cgi-bin/test.cgi  cgi-bin/.htaccess: AuthType Basic AuthName Test AuthUserFile /home/test/.htpasswd Require user a  The server asks for user a's password and the REMOTE_USER variable is shown.  To my mind this behavious is wrong because two .htaccess files are consulted, but not fully applied.  This may be the same bug as #11602.  I encountered the same problem when moving from 1.3.12 to 2.046. As suggested  by Joseph M. Hinkle, this has to do with mod_action, NOT .htaccess.   My config is as follows (Apache 2.046, Windows NT 4.0)  Action etat-ge-tdb /cgi-bin/tdb.cgi AddHandler etat-ge-tdb .tdb  In my Apache 1.3.12 config, there was no access limit on the script 'tdb.cgi'. Some of my *.tdb files had access limits, and in those cases the REMOTE_USER  was appropriately passed to tdb.cgi. Now it now longer works with Apache 2. My  workaround was to add a 'require valid-user' directive for /cgi-bin/tdb.cgi,  but this is not fully satisfactory since it is no longer possible to have  anonymous access for some of my *.tdb files.  Note : in Apache 1.3.12, I used MIME types instead of AddHandler; but this is  not the cause of the problem (Action with MIME types in Apache 2.046 still  does not transmit the REMOTE_USER). The problem is fixed in 2.1. The remote user of the original request will be passed via REDIRECT_REMOTE_USER to the script, which is even more logical than the old behaviour. If you want to get REMOTE_USER direcly, you should protect the script itself (which works already fine).  I'll propose it for backport to 2.0 stable branch.  Thanks for using Apache! *** Bug 11602 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 21927 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** This was fixed in 2.0.48-dev.

When compiling on FreeBSD threads are disabled by default in apache2 as stated in INSTALL.  compiling --with-ldap will fail because include/util_ldap.h uses apr_thread_mutex_t but as APR_HAS_THREADS is defined 0 that struct (typedefed somewhere else) from         srclib/apr/include/arch/unix/thread_mutex.h is not known.  ldap-aaa and ldap-cache also seem to depend on threads.  My question now is:  a) ldap stuff should also work without threads ? so can someone who    knows the code please have a look at and change it to also work    without threads.  b) please check for threads in configure when you need    them and do not allow the user to compile without; I am not    talking about -lpthread, which will also be found on FreeBSD,    but --{enable,disable}-threads.    [ ok, this may be tricky within actual build framework but      this should no longer be necessary if a) is done ;-) ]	The ldap code now supports a non-threaded environment such as APR-on-FreeBSD.  util_ldap.h was updated in httpd-2.0 CVS and various pieces were updated in  httpd-ldap CVS.  Your point about checking for features at configure time and disabling function as necessary is well taken.  Various such checks are present.

It avoids file name conflicts and just makes the code  clearer.  Thus, the appropriate directory to have in the INCLUDE path is  $OPENSSL_HOME/include and the syntax in your source code should be  #include <openssl/somefile.h>  NOT  #include <somefile.h>  This way a) it will build on MSVC and b) I can use the same INCLUDE setting for  my own OpenSSL code as Apache 2.

It's extremely useful in a two-tiered authentication system.  Let's say, for instance, that you have a firewall.  Further, that your business application lives 'inside' the firewall, while the authentication system is only operative 'outside' the firewall.  Apache on the firewall machines can do authentication just fine.  Apache on the internal machine cannot.  Instead, they have to believe that anything that gets through has already been authenticated.  This is exactly what I use this for. I hope, you're checking the anon uids in any other way. Otherwise everybody behind the firewall is granted access to the system...  I have, however, another security problems in my mind, because one can easily compromise the log files (by using weird user ids). Hmm.

In turn, the spot_cookie() function will then parse the Cookie2: request header, looking for the Apache cookie:      cookie = apr_table_get(r->headers_in,         (dcfg->style == CT_COOKIE2 ? 'Cookie2' : 'Cookie'))  However, reading the RFC 2965 specification, specifically section 3.3.5, it appears to me that the Cookie2: header is only used to indicate the highest version of the cookie specification that the client understands. Per 3.3.4, the actual cookie values are still sent in the Cookie: header. (See also 9.1 and the examples under 4.1 and 4.2.)  As a further note, it seems to me -- I could be reading the spec or code incorrectly, of course -- that the cookie parsing code in spot_cookie() may not really work with RFCs 2109 or 2965, because it doesn't accept commas as cookie delimiters, nor the whitespace or double-quote (') quoted-strings allowed by those RFCs.  See 10.1.3 in RFC 2109, as well as 4.1 and 4.3.4 in RFC 2109, and 3.1 and 3.3.4 in RFC 2965. My apologies if I've misread something!	Looking at the spot_cookie() code a bit more, I'm also suspicious that it may be confused by both RFC 2965-style cookies (which can have quoted-string values, with escaped characters).  Further, I think it will also be confused just by old-style cookies where the string 'Apache' (or whatever the cookie name it's looking for is) appears in a cookie name or value somewhere before the actual cookie name/value pair in the header.  For example, I suspect 'Apache2=foo; Apache=bar' or 'foo=Apache; Apache=bar' would both cause the apr_strstr_c() call to find the first, incorrect, occurance of 'Apache'.  Or, if the client has two valid 'Apache' cookies for the server, with different paths, it may send them both, with the more-specific path first ... but since we always set the path=/, our cookie will be the last one, not the first one.  if ((value = ap_strstr_c(cookie, dcfg->cookie_name))) {     char *cookiebuf, *cookieend;      value += strlen(dcfg->cookie_name) + 1;  /* Skip over the '=' */     cookiebuf = apr_pstrdup(r->pool, value);     cookieend = strchr(cookiebuf, ';');     if (cookieend)         *cookieend = '/0';      /* Ignore anything after a ; */  I don't know if this helps or not, but since I don't have time right now to implement a complete fix, I will attach a file that parses a Cookie: header into an APR hash of cookies, where each hash value is an APR array of 'string' structures.  The first structure in an array is the first cookie we found with the given name (the name is the hash key that points to the array), which should be the most-specific cookie of that name, assuming the client is working correctly.  The last structure in an array is the last cookie -- which is the one mod_usertrack would want, because it would have to be the path=/ cookie.  The 'string' structure contains both the string itself, null-terminated, and the string length, which is useful for avoiding additional strlen() calls. The cookie_get() function returns the string of the first cookie, or NULL if there is more than one cookie with the same name.  This obviously isn't useful for the mod_usertrack situation, where we want the last cookie in an array.  For that, you want to do something like (assuming you know there's at each one element in the array):  /**** DEBUG: watch out for nelts == 0 !! ****/ string = ((struct string*) val_arr->elts) + val_arr->nelts - 1; str = string->ptr; str_len = string->str_len;  When parsing the Cookie: header, if a $Version=1 cookie is detected at the start (or some legal RFC 2965 variation), then the code parses according to RFCs 2965 and 2616 (mostly); otherwise, it parses according to the old Netscape specification.  When parsing in RFC 2965-mode, cookie names are flattened to lowercase, since the spec calls for case-insensitive cookie names.  Quoted strings are de-quoted and escaped characters in quoted strings are un-escaped (except for some dubious values that RFC 2616 allows).  Unquoted cookie values must be RFC 2616 tokens, and all cookie names must be tokens as well. Both commas and semicolons are legal delimiters.  When parsing in Netscape-mode, cookie names and values are not altered, except that we ignore internal whitespace and commas, because the spec doesn't allow those at all.  Only semicolons are legal delimiters.  In general, high-bit-set octets and ASCII control characters are stripped out, despite what RFC 2616 allows, because -- well, because applications really shouldn't be using such stuff in an HTTP header, should they?  The code also imposes its own #defined limits on name and value lengths. This probably overkill given that the header is normally limited to about 8 Kb by the DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDSIZE #define, but this code came from another application where we didn't have such external limits.  Plus, it's worth noting that both the Netscape and RFC 2965 specs allow clients to send 20 cookies where each one's name/value pair is 4 Kb ... but any application that actually relied on that many large cookies would cause Apache errors for its clients, once they exceeded the 8 Kb header limit.  Maybe someday Cookie: headers should be allowed to exceed the DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDSIZE?  Or else, at least a warning about this conflict with the specs should maybe go in the docs.  The code tries hard to avoid excess strlen()-type calls and multiple passes over the data.  Although it would be more elegant to allocate key[] and val[] buffers off the stack for the maximum, dump characters into them as we find them, and then apr_palloc() just enough space for the resultant strings, that requires at least two passes over all the data.  Instead, this code starts by allocating a small buf_size buffer from apr_palloc(), and then, once it's filled up, allocating double that amount of space for the next buffer.  The doubling continues until a reasonable maximum is reached that can always contain the largest string we need to handle (ideally, several large strings). This does involve memcpy() calls when we have to reallocate in the middle of a name or value, and some wasted space, but we should avoid a full 2* pass over all the data, and not waste too much more space than we need.  Like I said, it's a bit of overkill just for the Cookie: header, but I had the code on hand.  The attached code should compile, but it differs slightly from our actual implementation usage, so I can't guarantee that it's bug-free.  Perhaps something like this might form part of an APR-util cookie library?  Or not ... Created an attachment (id=2624) Netscape and RFC 2695 compliant cookie parser  Oops, two extra comments: the last line of the cookie_parse_header() function should 'return APR_SUCCESS', not 'return OK', and this code simply skips over any cookies whose names start with $ when parsing in RFC 2965-mode. An enhancement would be to put those $name values into a fancier 'struct cookie' that contains the 'struct string', and push those structures onto the APR arrays. regarding the spotcookie problem misrecogonizing cookies: that was fixed recently...  no comment from me on your rfc compliance comment RFC issue Fixed in 2.1 and proposed for backport into the 2.0 and 1.3 stable branches.

11540	null	RESOLVED		Christoph Vogel	1028755260000	1185368498000		ProxyTimeout ignored Actually I tried to figure out what results when a configured ProxyTimeout has  expired. My testcase was as follows:  - a nVH with a working ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse set - low ProxyTimeout (2) setting within the nVH - iptables rule to simply drop incoming proxied host's traffic  The connection hangs until Apache's main Timeout value (default setting) from  UAs point of view and it doesn't matter if ProxyTimeout was set or not. Additionally I tried to set ProxyTimeout in the main config with identical  behaviour (leaving ProxyPass(Reverse) in its place). I didn't try ProxyTimeout within a configuration for Apache as regular client  proxy, so it might be entailed with ProxyPass(Reverse) merely.	Same behaviour with 2.0.40 From investigating this, ProxyTimeout only applies after the connection is successfully established, which won't happen if the packets are dropped. Will check further to see if this is correct behaviour or not.  *** Bug 23122 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Confirmed - the ProxyTimeout applies after a successful connection. To test this, you need to convince your test connection to connect successfully, but then not send any data. The proxy should wait the timeout length for a response, and give up if this time is reached.  I'm closing this bug for now, if you have further problems, reopen it.   I'm facing this problem with IHS2.042.2 (Apache/2.0.46) on AIX.  Simply put, I have an upstream application server that takes about 15mins to  generate a large report. The reverse proxy returns a 502 error to the client  after the connection timeout period elapses (which is normal). I can overcome  the problem by increasing the Timeout directive, but believe it would be more  appropriate to use the ProxyTimeout directive. This does not, however, produce  the desired effect.  Perhaps the last comment 'ProxyTimeout applies after a successful connection'  could be clarified in more detail? My observation is ProxyTimeout (by 2.0.51) rather sets the Connect timeout, not the read timeout. Another bug regarding ProxyTimeout is, that neither Timeout nor ProxyTimeout apply when an SSL proxy connection ('CONNECT') is established. These connections never time out. Timeout for socket in case of proxy request set in modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c     by function ap_proxy_connect_to_backend():          /* Set a timeout on the socket */         if (conf->timeout_set == 1) {             apr_socket_timeout_set(*newsock, conf->timeout);         }         else {              apr_socket_timeout_set(*newsock, s->timeout);         }  GDB show, that conf->timeout_set is 0, and timeout get from global config (from 'Timeout' directive).  Note, that other *_set variable never used in mod_proxy* for check something.  I don't know why conf->timeout_set is zero in ap_proxy_connect_to_backend().  May be need compared 2 functions from modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c: create_proxy_config and merge_proxy_config  Check this: ps->timeout= (overrides->timeout_set == 0) ? base->timeout : overrides->timeout; If overrides->timeout_set equal 0, than ps->timeout setted, but may be we need set too :    ps->timeout_set = 1;    /* because timeout set always, timeout_set is always setted */ ?  But probably we don't need use *_set variable anywhere in proxy_utils to check.  next patch work in my environment: diff -u  modules/proxy/proxy_util.c.save  modules/proxy/proxy_util.c --- modules/proxy/proxy_util.c.save     Tue Nov 23 14:47:48 2004 +++ modules/proxy/proxy_util.c  Tue Nov 23 14:48:46 2004 @@ -1128,7 +1128,7 @@  #endif            /* Set a timeout on the socket */ -        if (conf->timeout_set == 1) { +        if (conf->timeout != 0) {              apr_socket_timeout_set(*newsock, conf->timeout);          }          else {   Created an attachment (id=15511) ensures <opt>_set properties are set correctly in merge_proxy_config  ProxyTimeout directive is ignored because the timeout_set property gets cleared in merge_proxy_config.\tAttached patch resolves this problem Created an attachment (id=15512) 2.1.3-beta: ensures <opt>_set properties are set correctly in merge_proxy_config  This bug just bit me too.

I guess he is hit by  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200705.mbox/%3c464F4E80.9020202@apache.org%3e The ProxyTimeout setting for mod_proxy is not working as described. According to the documentation, ProxyTimeout should 'fail gracefully instead of waiting however long it takes the server to return.'  This means that ProxyTimeout setting should cause mod_proxy to return an error back to the user instead of waiting until the Server's main Timeout value is reached, which it is doing now. It seems the ProxyTimeout is currently ignored as everyone else here describes.  For example if Apache has a Timeout of 60 seconds and ProxyTimeout is 10 seconds, then mod_proxy should return an error message back to the user if after 10 seconds it did not receive a response to the server it connected to.

Sorry for this impersonal response, but we get many more bug reports than our volunteers can keep up with. Thanks for using Apache! I have reproduced this bug using the latest Apache 2.0.44 (Win32).

11793	null	CLOSED		Sebastian Wolfgarten	1029607440000	1029959842000		Parse error in ExtFilterDefine Hello,  I'm currently playing with output filters. I thought of using awk to print out the number of each line. In my bash shell I used this:  echo '<html>' | awk '{print NR ':' $N}'  I add the following lines to my httpd.conf:  ExtFilterDefine awk_line_numbering mode=output outtype=text/html  cmd='/bin/awk '{print NR/': /' $N}''  <Location />  SetOutputFilter awk_line_numbering  </Location>  Now when I start the apache I get a syntax error.   Unexpected parameter: ": /' $N}'''  I suppose this is a bug because some external programs like awk need to use quotation marks in order to work. A workaround is to put the awk command in an extra shell script but I assume this to be a bug.  My friend Werner Schalk has already posted this to the users mailing list of apache but they said I should use back-slashes (what I did anyway) or to report a bug. Here it is :-)  Bye and thanks, Sebastian Wolfgarten	Did you try   ExtFilterDefine awk_line_numbering mode=output outtype=text/html       cmd='/bin/awk '{print NR///': ///' $N}''  In case the '/' escaping is eating the second double quote?  If that's not the workaround, there is a bug in the parser.  This indeed seems to be a bug. parse_cmd in mod_ext_filter.c does not process escaping characters. It sees the first ' and scans till it finds the next '. No checks for escape chars.  I'll have a fix shortly. If you need a line numbering ExtFilter urgently you can use pr without getting  into escaping issues:  ExtFilterDefine pr_line_numbering cmd='/usr/bin/pr -n -t'  This was fixed earlier today (go Paul!).  I just verified that this  cmd= parameter yields a filter that prefixes the response with line  numbers:  cmd='/bin/awk '{print NR/': /' $N}''  To pick up the fix, you need a new modules/experimental/mod_ext_filter.c  and a new srclib/apr/strings/apr_cpystrn.c.  This will all be in the  next release of Apache 2.0.x.

12091	null	CLOSED		Jess Holle	1030469520000	1030562327000		Apache 2 httpd-ldap modules crash on Windows on startup The Apache 2 modules in the httpd-ldap sub-project (which should be moved  into 'experimental' in my opinion and have standard MSVC++ projects created,  etc -- though I have no vote) crash on Windows 2000 in Apache 2.0.40.  The issue is use of uninitialized memory in util_ldap_cache_init() [in  util_ldap_cache.c].  This routine declares a variable on stack, 'rmm_lock', and  passes it to apr_rmm_init() without initializing it.  apr_rmm_init() expects  this argument to be initialized and causes a later crash on Windows as a result  of finding random gargly-gook in this structure and interpretting it in such a  way that does not match the reality of the situation.  My patch (sorry I'm new at this and don't know how to generate proper patches :- (  ) is to no longer declare this variable and pass NULL to apr_rmm_init() in  its place -- as apr_rmm_init() can take a NULL for this argument.  This seems  to work fine on Windows and Solaris -- though I can't get this module to load  on AIX (no, I've not yet tried the original code....)  The line are (in patch pseudo-syntax):  Lines 293-297:   apr_status_t util_ldap_cache_init(apr_pool_t *pool, apr_size_t reqsize)   { -     apr_anylock_t rmm_lock;    #if APR_HAS_SHARED_MEMORY  and lines 305-308:       /* This will create a rmm 'handler' to get into the shared memory area */   -    apr_rmm_init(&util_ldap_rmm, &rmm_lock,   +    apr_rmm_init(&util_ldap_rmm, NULL,               (void *)apr_shm_baseaddr_get(util_ldap_shm), reqsize, pool);   #endif  The only alternative that I see is to add a call to initialize 'rmm_lock', but  from my brief (and possibly completely wrong) scan of the code it would appear  that passing null is a more efficient way of accomplishing the same thing.

12132	null	CLOSED		Rob Cromwell	1030554840000	1030661636000		mod_rewrite Set-Cookie bug There is a bug in mod_rewrite that prevents you from setting the expiration date of a cookie using the cookie|CO flag in the RewriteRule directive.  The documentation states that the flag uses the following fields:  'cookie|CO=NAME:VAL:domain[:lifetime]' (set cocookie)    The optional parameter 'lifetime' is the lifetime of the cookie in minutes.  Currently, when you provide this field with any positive integer, it appears to be ignored by rewrite.  The cookie's expiration date is always set to the server's current time in GMT.  Here is an example that *should* set the cookie lifetime to be one day.   RewriteRule .* - [CO=MyCookie:1:mydomain.com:1440]   The root of the problem can be found on line 4159 of mod_rewrite.c, the 'lifetime' in seconds of the cookie is added to the request time to get the expiration date.  Currently, the 'lifetime' in seconds is being added as a long. The seconds should be transformed into apr_time before being added to the request time.  r->request_time + (60 * atol(expires))  Should be changed to   r->request_time + apr_time_from_sec((60 * atol(expires)))	I'll do this soon also need to fix the same spot to set it so it will be in err_headers out Fixed in current CVS. also.. the Cookie is now being sent out in err_headers_out so it should show up in stuff like 302's and 404's			Ian Holsman

12202	null	CLOSED		Andrew Ho	1030752780000	1030906037000		If-None-Match requests always return 304 with FileETag None directive If Apache has the FileETag directive set to 'None' and an If-None-Match header  is sent in a request, Apache always sends back a 304 Not Modified response,  regardless of the content of the ETag(s) sent in the If-None-Match header.  This bug is pretty high priority, because it means that if a site running  Apache normally serves ETags but then stops serving them by setting FileETag  None, any downstream caches which understand ETags and send If-None-Match  requests will stop getting updated content.  How to reproduce:      1. Make a regular HTTP request to Apache for any static file,        and note its ETag.      2. Make another HTTP request for that file, sending an If-None-Match        header (for example, if the ETag from step 1 is 'abcdef', send        the header If-None-Match: 'abcdef'). Apache should correctly        return a 304 Not Modified response.      3. Make a new If-None-Match request with a bogus ETag, for example        by sending If-None-Match: 'xxx'. Apache should correctly return        a 200 OK and include an entity body.      4. Add a FileETag None directive to the Apache configuration,        and restart Apache.      5. Make the same If-None-Match request as in step 2. Again, Apache        should correctly return a 304 Not Modified response.      6. Make the same bogus If-None-Match request as in step 3 (or any        other If-None-Match request with a bogus ETag). Apache will        incorrectly return a 304 Not Modified response.  Steps 4 and 6 are enough to reproduce the bug but the other steps give a little  context by showing the correct behavior.  We have reproduced this bug with Apache 1.3.23 on OpenBSD and Apache 1.3.26 on  Solaris x86. We strongly suspect the bug to be platform independent; a quick  perusal of the code makes it look like the culprit is the strstr() inside  ap_meets_conditions() in src/main/http_protocol.c (line 612 of the Apache  1.3.26 distribution):      if_nonematch = ap_table_get(r->headers_in, 'If-None-Match');     if (if_nonematch != NULL) {         if (r->method_number == M_GET) {             if (if_nonematch[0] == '*')                 return HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED;             if (etag != NULL) {                 if (ap_table_get(r->headers_in, 'Range')) {                     if (etag[0] != 'W' &&                         ap_find_list_item(r->pool, if_nonematch, etag)) {                         return HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED;                     }                 }    /* here */   else if (strstr(if_nonematch, etag)) {                     return HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED;                 }  The problem appears to be that when FileETag None is set, the If-None-Match  header is set to '' because ap_make_etag() returns '' in that case.  Unfortunately, strstr(str, '') always returns true, so Apache incorrectly  returns 304 Not Modified for all requests.  A quick hack would be to have ap_make_etag() return an impossible sentinel  value instead of '' when FileETag None is set. A better fix would be to ignore  the If-None-Match logic altogether if FileETag None is set, as there is no  other sensible behavior.	I have confirmed that the bug exists in the current CVS HEAD.

This bug is pretty high priority, because it means that if a site running  Apache normally serves ETags but then stops serving them by setting FileETag  None, any downstream caches which understand ETags and send If-None-Match  requests will stop getting updated content.  How to reproduce:      1. Make a regular HTTP request to Apache for any static file,        and note its ETag.      2. Make another HTTP request for that file, sending an If-None-Match        header (for example, if the ETag from step 1 is 'abcdef', send        the header If-None-Match: 'abcdef'). Apache should correctly        return a 304 Not Modified response.      3. Make a new If-None-Match request with a bogus ETag, for example        by sending If-None-Match: 'xxx'. Apache should correctly return        a 200 OK and include an entity body.      4. Add a FileETag None directive to the Apache configuration,        and restart Apache.      5. Make the same If-None-Match request as in step 2. Again, Apache        should correctly return a 304 Not Modified response.      6. Make the same bogus If-None-Match request as in step 3 (or any        other If-None-Match request with a bogus ETag). Apache will        incorrectly return a 304 Not Modified response.  Steps 4 and 6 are enough to reproduce the bug but the other steps give a little  context by showing the correct behavior.  I have reproduced this bug with Apache 2.0.40 on Solaris x86. I strongly  suspect the bug to be platform independent, as it is a simple missing check in  http_protocol.c for an empty ETag. Apache 1.3 has an identical bug, for which  details can be found in Bug 12202.	Created an attachment (id=2880) Patch against httpd-2.0/modules/http/http_protocol.c  Still a problem in HEAD. The attached patch fixes the problem. Fixed in revision 1.455 of http_protocol.c.			Andrew Ho	Justin Erenkrantz
12340	null	RESOLVED		Chris Ward	1031245920000	1191776362000		WindowsXP proxy, child process exited with status 3221225477 I'm using Apache as a cacheing proxy on a WindowsXP system (the upstream link is Starband satellite, the downstream link is a wireless LAN around my house). Apache2 breaks with messages below in the log; the web browsers get some rather disjointed sessions. Apache1 works fine. I get notices about Apache wanting to notify Microsoft about the problem, which I duly allow it to do. I'm not sure whether the problem is related to Apache on WindowsXP, or 'mod_proxy' etc. I am running without any upstream proxies. Starband have a strange scheme involving running half the TCP stack on my computer and the other half back that their satellite base station, but it works most of the time.

Bug also in apache 2.0.39 in same place.  Can you please attach your httpd.config file, and the actual URL requested which gives the crash ?  if this is a forward proxy, the r->filename should already by mapped to proxy:http://foobar/uri by the time it gets into this function (or else it would be breaking for >every< request anyone does, so there is something funky about your config I'm thinking Here proposed patch for fixing this bug (maked by 'diff mod_proxy.c fixed/mod_proxy.c' command):  255,256c255,256 <     if (!r->proxyreq || strncmp(r->filename, 'proxy:', 6) != 0) <         return DECLINED; --- >     if (!r->proxyreq) return DECLINED; >     if (strncmp(r->filename, 'proxy:', 6) != 0) return DECLINED;    It seems that in 'if' operator (in compiled code) both condition are checked even though first already truly. Thanks for high-speed fix. I take it that you don't need my config file any more; if you want it, let me know. Executing code to evaluate 'b' in (a || b) when it is not logically needed sounds like a compiler bug. Whose compiler do you build Apache for Windows with ? Would they be interested in a bug report ?  The oddity in my configuration is that I run an Apache proxy on Windows.  I am running 2.0.42 now, and the problem is fixed. Thanks ! This is giving me the same breakage again in 2.0.47; has the broken code crept back in ? *** Bug 18963 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   I'm running Win2K Advanced Server, Apache 2.0.47 with PHP 4.3.3 and NO  mod_proxy loaded, and I'm reporting the same problems. Some of the times the  service actually stops (it's automaticaly restarted by Win 60 s latter), the  rest of the times Apache seems to handle it on his own . I have a low thread  count (15) because of persistent connections do the database and the server is  pretty much exclusive.    Before I had 2.0.39 and all was fine, I tried downgrading to 2.0.46 and the  problem persisted. Didn't really wanted to downgrade much further, so I'll wait  for the outcome of this 'bug' :).    Further log details in :    http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23300 I'm using 'squid' as cacheing proxy now (under WindowsXP Home). Works fine, and the license terms are just as good. Apache good web server, squid good proxycache, XMail good mailrouterthing ... I'm experiencing the same problem with Apache 2.0.54 with PHP 5.0.4 on WinXP  SP1, mod_proxy is not loaded. The error occurs sporadically, sometimes with the page partly sent to the  client. After Apache has automatically restarted, reloading the page does not  reproduce the error. I also receive this error on using phpmyadmin. Here is one of the URLs causing the error:  http://localhost/phpmy/sql.php?lang=de-utf-8&server=1&collation_connection=utf8_general_ci&db=phpbb&table=phpbb_auth_access&sql_query=SELECT+%2A+FROM+%60phpbb_auth_access%60&pos=0&goto=tbl_properties_structure.php (In reply to comment #0) I'm using XAMPP 1.5.1 on Windows XP Home with SP1 and SP2. No other server running.  I have the error, too. I'm not using Perl when it's running.I did not compile, I used the .zip version, unzipped in top-level directory.I've read all the bug reports here, and it seems this bug dissappeared, then reappeared again.  I have the following in my httpd-mpm.conf  <IfModule mpm_winnt_module>     ThreadsPerChild     250     MaxRequestsPerChild   0     Win32DisableAcceptEx </IfModule>  and httpd.conf has the appropriate line uncommented to Apache will read httpd-mpm.conf.  That was the suggested fix for problem when CPU usage maxes out on XP Home. Proposed fix does not work. When I attempt to view an HTML page that processes a PHP script (whether hard-coded in the HTML or called via SSI virtual), very often the CPU usage goes to 100%, Windows gives me an error 'Apache has encountered a problem and needs to close', and the page never loads.  There is no port conflict, but I tried changing to port 8080 just to see if that helped, and it doesn't. My firewall is not blocking anything, the first time I started Apache I chose to allow Apache to run as a server and to have the firewall remember this answer.

12353	null	CLOSED		Owen Rees	1031298120000	1044108784000		Server creates empty meta files where MetaFiles on In directories where I have 'MetaFiles on', if 'file.meta' does not exist, the  server creates an empty 'file.meta' when 'file' is accessed. If 'file.meta'  exists, the server creates 'file.meta.meta' when 'file' is accessed and so on  adding a new file with an extra '.meta' each time.  Problem first seen after upgrading from 1.x to 2.0.39 on an HP-UX 10.20 system.  Currently running 2.0.40 built after deleting '| APR_CREATE' from the call of  apr_file_open in mod_cern_meta.c (line 383). This seems to fix the problem with  no obvious side effects seen with a few simple tests.	Thanks for your report/patch, and thanks for using Apache!  Your fix has just been committed to 2.1-dev and proposed for merging back to 2.0.45-dev.  FYI... the fix has been merged back to the stable tree for inclusion in 2.0.45			Jeff Trawick

The data will be stored in a brigade and an input filter will be added just after the http_header_filter. That input filter has the data from it's ctx.  So in any subsequent read call that input filter will be invoked and  can return the stored data.   P.S. Im not sure if the upload of the diff is ok, so I paste it to be sure   *** mod_ssl.h.patched\tThu Dec 18 13:11:48 2003 --- mod_ssl.h\tThu Dec 18 13:13:19 2003 *************** *** 709,714 **** --- 709,715 ----   void         ssl_io_filter_init(conn_rec *, SSL *);   void         ssl_io_filter_register(apr_pool_t *);   long         ssl_io_data_cb(BIO *, int, MODSSL_BIO_CB_ARG_TYPE *, int, long, long); + long         ssl_io_suck(request_rec *);      /*  PRNG  */   int          ssl_rand_seed(server_rec *, apr_pool_t *, ssl_rsctx_t, char *); *** ssl_engine_kernel.c.patched\tThu Dec 18 13:11:39 2003 --- ssl_engine_kernel.c\tThu Dec 18 13:15:04 2003 *************** *** 583,596 ****        *        * !!

Hartmut, to keep bugs in the loop please don't resolve  them as fixed until they're reviewed and/or committed at least to one dev-tree. Anyway, thanks for  the patch. Also, this configuration does not activate the bug : SSLEngine on SSLVerifyClient optional SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate <location /location/ >         SSLVerifyClient optional         SSLVerifyDepth 10 </location> I was having a similar problem with per-directory SSL authentication with DAV. (Note that the patch posted earlier does not fix the problem for DAV.)  I have worked around the problem by having a global 'SSLVerifyClient optional' directive.  The per-directory 'SSLVerifyClient required' is then processed properly.  This seems to preserve all of the behavior that I need.  Those without a certificate can still access the site via SSL, and the entire site, including the portions using SSL authentication, work for those with proper certificates. This may need no more than clarification in the documentation.  I have attempted usage of all posts in this bug to date.  I have used the patch, no dice.  I have altered my configurations as noted by the posts mentioning that the bug will not be enabled with a configuration change, again no dice.  I have also used several configurations noted in errors by the apache software and nothing works.  I always get 'SSL Re-negotiation in conjunction with POST method not supported!' when the SSL is renegotiated and the next method is a POST instead of a GET.  I find it hard to swallow ('because I am a huge fan of Apache and mod_ssl'), that Apache organization would make such a glaring flaw in the 2.0 builds considering all this worked great in the 1.3 builds.  My final resolution because I am in a production environment (until Apache org. fixes the problem).  Go back to the 1.3 build ASAP. Hello,  I also applied all 'remedies' so far mentioned by others (including patching),  to no avail, the problem is still alive and healthy.  As a consequence, we are  considering going back to 1.3 as well.  I'm reluctant to go in this direction,  but without progress for months now, there seems to be no perspective for 2.0  within environments requiring client certs and the POST method....  BTW: You should remove the 'PatchAvailable' keyword.  No offense for the creator  of the patch, but it simply doesn't work.

Have there been any updates on this issue since the last comment filed on July 8th of this year?  No; I'm not really convinced the solution I was working on can be made to be secure.  Note that for many configurations, there is a simple workaround: add    SSLVerifyClient optional  to the SSL vhost config, as well as the 'SSLVerifyClient require' in whatever Location/Directory context. I was reminded privately that the other workaround for this bug is of course to ensure that the first access the browser makes to the SSLVerifyClient-protected location uses a GET request rather than a POST request. *** Bug 31314 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Some general comments;  HTTP/1.0    the 'classic' HTTP/1.0 handling -must- buffer the body if the connection   will be renegotiated.  This should no longer be handled inside the mod_ssl   module itself, by itself.  With the advent of filters, either apreq2 or   another 'client buffer' module must be implemented.  The logic looks like;      brigade read loop       mem_body > max_memory_body ?         create tmpfile if tmpfile isnull         response 'failure' if total_body > max_buffer_body         write body -> tmpfile     reopen tmpfile read-only     insert tmpfile bucket of tmpfile prior to remaining mem_body buckets.    now we have two controls that would prevent DoS attacks present in the   original fix proposed (unbounded growth of the body.)  Remember, the   renegotiation would NOT determine the client certificate is valid until   after these resources had been consumed by a nefarious client.    I rather like the idea of apreq2 doing this work, and actually, integrating   apreq2 as a 'stock' apache module.  apreq2 does nothing until some module   in the server configuration wants to use its services.  HTTP/1.1 + client Expect: 100-continue    http://rfc.net/rfc2616.html#s8.2.3    Clients which truly pause for 100-continue could be satisfied with no   buffering of the body.  Schedule the renegotation prior to sending the   100 CONTINUE response.  Finally note that this is not specific to POST, it's generic to all HTTP methods which contain a client body.  The headers may be inspected to determine if the client is attempting to push a body with the request.   Isn't there any way to suppress renegotiation ? Workaround!!!  Following configuration works fine (optional for any except with CA  certificate, and required to an especific location):  SSLEngine on SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca SSLVerifyDepth  2 SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate <location /any_location/ >         SSLVerifyClient require </location>  Regards,  Bruno Santiago 'SSLVerifyClient optional' seems also safe. Is 'SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate' really needed, or is it an optimisation ? Is it totally safe ? The doc states to use this carefully. (In reply to comment #34) > 'SSLVerifyClient optional' seems also safe. > Is 'SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate' really needed, or is it an optimisation ? > Is it totally safe ? The doc states to use this carefully.   The workaround explained above is not safe at least for apache 2.0.52. ' RE: [users@httpd] Bug or Feature : global SSLVerifyClient in <VirtualHost> overrides the same in  <Location>?  Simple test scenario is : 1. access document root location - 'SSLVerifyClient optional' ,  cancel certificate choice window. 2. access location <Location '/auth'> with  'SSLVerifyClient require' - no triggered SSL negotiation - access without certificate granted.  Correct should be the following behaviour, but there is no re-negotiation: >SSLVerifyClient is documented as working in directory context, so it should also work in <Location> context. The manual page for mod_ssl does  >explicitly say that a SSL renegotiation is triggered if a request for the location is received.    config sample:  <VirtualHost>  SSLVerifyClient optional   Alias /auth   /htdocs/access  <Location '/access'>  SSLVerifyClient require  SSLOptions +ExportCertData +StdEnvVars +OptRenegotiate SSLVerifyDepth 5  Options None  </Location>   </VirtualHost>   '       Proposed workaround is to add an additional <VirtualHost> and  configure in its context SSLVerifyClient require.   In my particular case creating webapi virtualhost suppose to fix problems with axis.           The problem mentioned in comment 35 is a separate issue from the bug covered here, and is fixed by: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=264800&view=rev I was told to use something like this:  <VirtualHost ...>    ...    SSLVerifyClient none    ...    <Location /plop>       ...       SSLVerifyClient require       ...    </Location> </VirtualHost>  And this seems to work fine. Can someone confirm this is working correctly and I'm not missing some 'feature' for this bug ? Thanks If the bug isn't fixed, the issue is that the Location-specific renegotiation fails on a POST.

But also 'Options -FollowSymLinks' combined with 'RewriteEngine off' results in  this error message and I this, that this is a bug.

But in the subdirectory 'cgi-bin' there seems to be implicitly 'Options -FollowSymLinks' and even an explicit 'Options +FollowSymLinks' does not work (WHY???) and therefore I want to set 'RewriteEngine off' there,  in order to be able to use the 'cgi-bin' directory without getting the above- mentioned error message.

It appears that the ldap authentication modules are essentially passing the  authentication name bytes along exactly as received, rather than re-encoding  them in UTF-8 as required by the RFC.  This appears to apply regardless of  which LDAP libraries are used (iPlanet/Netscape or OpenLDAP).  This severely limits this module for any locale outside the US.  [This issue also applies to the www.rudedog.org module upon which the httpd- ldap modules are based.]	   If you modify your httpd.conf file in utf-8, providing a legit non-ASCII, utf-8   encoded AuthName string, what happens?   A new directive AuthLDAPCharsetConfig was added which specifies a charset conversion file to fix this problem.  Patch was applied to v2.1.0-dev in December, and to v2.0.45-dev in January.

12655	null	CLOSED		William Drury	1032055320000	1118788952000		 sometimes causing QUERY_STRING variable to be garbage. I have run into this problem in both 2.0.39 and 2.0.40.  Using httpd 2.0.40 in Linux Mandrake 8.2, compiled without any external modules (but with --enable-rewrite), I have set the following things in httpd.conf:  AddHandler cgi-script .sgi AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .sgi  My intent is to server-parse the output of cgi scripts whose filename ends with .sgi.  This seems to work, if I print '<!--set VAR=/'FOO/' VALUE=/'bar/' -->/n' ; in the script, it is indeed set, so that code like:  <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/foo.sgi?$QUERY_STRING' --> <!--#if expr='$FOO' --> Foo is set. <!--#else --> Foo is not set. <!--#endif -->  produces the expected final output 'Foo is set.'.  However, if I have several 'include virtual' statements in the same .shtml file, there appears to be a problem.  If I add more include virtual statements to this file, like:  <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/foo.sgi?$QUERY_STRING' --> <!--#include virtual='/somefile.html' --> <!--#include virtual='/another_existing_file.html' --> <PRE> <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/printenv?$QUERY_STRING' --> </PRE>  ... printenv will show QUERY_STRING to be an empty string, and QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED to be a disturbingly different line of garbage each time.  I'm available to test fixes on my example setup.  William Drury	This is probably related to bug 12542. This behaviour is still occurring in 2.0.42 It works for me with HEAD. Can you please test the current version with your setup and confirm?  Thanks! No further response. Assuming issue resolved.  Please reopen the bug if this is not the case and you can provide additional information.  Thanks for using Apache.  the bug still exists in 2.0.54.  the problem is that during subrequest processing, QUERY_STRING is allocated from subrequest's own r->pool that gets destroyed later, invalidating the table entry in the global suprocess_env.  apr_pool_join(r->main->pool, r->pool); which, if i'm correct, is supposed to take care of subrequest's pool lifetime, is effectively a nop when compiled without APR_POOL_DEBUG (--enable-pool-debug).  there might be other consequences of assuming extended lifetime of subrequest's pool, but in regard to QUERY_STRING i have made a small patch that i attach to this bug.  having investigated this i find the issue obvious enough, but i can arrange a testcase if requested. Created an attachment (id=15216) the patch for QUERY_STRING case  Hmmm, interesting.  Do you have a simple test case which reliably reproduces the issue, I can't get the examples above to fail?  But I don't disagree with your analysis, though I'm not convinced your fix is sufficient.  Are there other places where r->main->subprocess_env will get populated from r->pool during the subrequest?  I think there are: e.g.,  handle_set().  The apr_pool_join() call isn't supposed to actually do anything for non-debug builds; it just says 'I guarantee that this subpool won't be destroyed before its parent'.  But in fact that guarantee is not really given: the subrequest r->pool *is* destroyed, when ap_destroy_sub_req is called.  So a possibly more correct fix would be to just remove the call to ap_destroy_sub_request.  Does that fix your case, also? i have even shorter test case.  http://testcase12655.rbc.ru:88/?testQS - non-patched 2.0.54, QS3 should contain garbage.  http://testcase12655.rbc.ru/?testQS - patched, should be ok.  you can browse the source here: http://testcase12655.rbc.ru/index.txt http://testcase12655.rbc.ru/q.txt http://testcase12655.rbc.ru/empty.txt (every .shtml has a corresponding .txt symlink)  i don't normally hack apache, so i can't say if there are other places to fix pool usage in subrequests... i'm glad that i brought your attntion to this issue so it can be fixed thoroughly :) Thanks a lot, that was a great help.  I've committed a fix for this to the trunk and will propose it for backport to 2.0.x.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=179763&view=rev Now merged for 2.0.55.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=264762&view=rev *** Bug 36452 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Andr??

This is a very minor issue but could cause stupid people like myself consternation when they upgrade their equipment.	   Invoking the .exe's should be a pre-build step of ApacheCore.dsp, methinks.   With a target file of the actual .h and the source being the .exe itself.    If you feel like authoring a patch - you could also set up a custom cl step   to compile buildmark.c as a pre-link step - I did that in httpd-2.0's   libhttpd.dsp, but have been to busy to invest much time.  Happy to review   your patch if you would like to submit.    buildmark.c is now a pre-build step.  Now ApacheCore.dsp builds both of the   test_char.h and uri_delims.h files so they should no longer conflict or   exhibit the odd behaviors that you observed.

The problem is that only the first process  is able to create the file, all the other processes fail to create the file  because it already exists. This disables caching on all processes other than  the initial process. Caching LDAP authentication is essential as this is a slow  task, especially with Microsoft Active Directory. One solution on linux is to  use an anonymous shared memory file (fileName is NULL) but apparently anonymous  shared memory is not supported on other platforms. I assume all processes  should share a single cache. Would anonymous shared memory create a new file  for each process? If this is not desired, only the first process should create  the file and all the other processes should attach to in.

The correct directive should be: AddLanguage sv .sv	This was fixed in Apache 1.3 on Tue Mar  5 08:14:25 PST 2002, following a bug report from me. That bug report had the internal identification "config/10040'. A fix for this bug also requires that the file 'htdocs/index.html.se' is renamed to 'htdocs/index.html.sv' Created an attachment (id=3157) Fixes docs/conf/httpd-std.conf.in  Created an attachment (id=3158) Fix for docs/conf/httpd-win.conf  Created an attachment (id=3159) Fix for docs/conf/httpd-nw.conf  This is not, strictly speaking, a bug.  The extension that is chosen for the filename is arbitrary.  We could just as well use .sweden-is-cool. What matters is that the correct language code is getting applied to that extension, and that is happening.  But it would probably be better if the extension and language code is consistent, unless there is some good reason to do otherwise.  On the other hand, I'm leaning very close to removing all the AddLanguage lines from httpd.conf except those necessary to do the documentation.  I don't see the benefit from us maintaining those.  All they create is bug reports ;-)  (And, as a final note, it shouldn't be necessary to rename the index.html.se file because the welcome page now uses a typemap rather than multiviews.) But why have the arbitrary chosen extension set to something that people get annoyed about? The map is for languages, se represents the country Sverige (Sweden) and sv the language Svenska (Swedish) according to ISO639: http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso639/iso639-en.html ISO639-2 uses three characters per language though..

Can someone please check these in? *sigh* two points:  - again: file naming has nothing to do with language codes.   (e.g. .pl for Polish is a quite bad choice) - what is your 'replacement' meant for? It's exactly the same file that exists now.  But to be consistent with 1.3 and to make you guys happy ;-), I'm going to change the config and the filename... Fixed for the next release (2.0.45).			Andr?? Malo	Dennis Lundberg	Joshua Slive	Tomas

I cannot get the DocumentRoot prepended to the processed URL *UNLESS* it  already contains a drive letter (in the RewriteCase). The log results are as  follows (last few lines only):  With a drive letter:  ...(2) local path result: c:/sebastian.tld/www/ ...(2) prefixed with document_root to C:/Apache/sitexc:/sebastian.tld/www/ ...(1) go-ahead with C:/Apache/sitexc:/sebastian.tld/www/ [OK]  Without drive letter:  ...(2) local path result: /sebastian.tld/www/  Without the drive letter already there, logging never reports the 'OK'  Guess this is a problem only effecting Win32 systems.....?  My conditions are in the httpd.conf and were based around the examples in the  documentation for virtual hosting (this code fails on my system):  RewriteEngine On  RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower  RewriteCond  %{REQUEST_URI}               !^/cgi-bin/ RewriteCond  ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}}\t  ^([a-z0-9/_/-]+)/.(.+)$ RewriteRule  ^/(.*)$                      /%2/%1/$1  RewriteCond  %{REQUEST_URI}               ^/cgi-bin/ RewriteCond  ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}}    ^([a-z0-9/_/-]+)/.(.+)$ RewriteRule  ^/(.*)$                      /%2/$1  When Fails HTTP Err 400 is generated....otherwise a 404 is generated.  This example worked fine with 1.3.4  Rik	The problem lies function hook_uri2line, beginning on line 1285:  1. the module (I think) wants to make sure that the resulting filename starts with a slash, but it uses the ap_os_is_path_absolute function. If the filename does indeed start with a slash this call will succeed on Unix, but it will fail on Windows because ap_os_is_path_absolute will expect a path starting with D:/ or //machine/share. Hence the '400 Bad Request' error.  2. next the module check if the first part ('the prefix') of the path exists. This is done using the prefix_stat function which works only on Unixes (it expects the path to start with a slash!)  I think the first part is unnecessary and that the second part should be based on core.c (as stated in the comments).    The fact is that '/foo' isn't an absolute path.on Windows.  In all fairness,   we should still try to work around this.  Note the earlier code was much   more evil, in that 'c:/foo' wasn't recognized as a rooted path.    The one case I want to avoid is accepting 'c:foo' since that path is most   definately not sufficiently rooted.  So that said, we should try to test   the APR_EINCOMPLETE result and have a static is_path_rooted function within   mod_rewrite to test the complete and some incomplete path results.    Don't have time to work up a patch at the moment, but thought I ought to   add some observations while they are fresh in my mind.  I to am having this EXACT problem. I thought maybe i just wasn't getting the  grasp of Mod_Rewrite, but it turns out to be a bug!  :-(  Any update on this bug? Been a couple of months. After a bit of playing around, I found that version 1.3.26 did NOT suffer from  the same problem - in fact I was hard pressed to find problems with mod_rewrite  in the 1.3.26 packaged version on win32. Dunno if this helps anyone? Sorry for  not updating sooner.....spoon reminded me!!! Some patches were made to the main dev branch (2.1) and are proposed for backport. I think, they will solve your problems and hopefully they will go into next 2.0 and 1.3 releases.  Thanks for your reports and thanks for using Apache! Wonder how long till the next release :-)  Is there a workaround in 2.x that  was not mentioned? Possibly some way of tricking it? Or possibly access to  apache-dev? Uh, sorry overlooked your questions ...  However, it should be fixed in 2.0.45. Please reopen this report if it's not.  Thanks.			Andr?? Malo	Rik Arpino	Silvester Erdeg	Will Rowe	spoon

I cannot back up your theory I'm  affraid since I immediatelly downgraded to 2.0.40 (downgrade, never thought I  would do that). But it is likely that you are right. Fixed in CVS.  Mod_Dav was setting the handler for all requests for a DAV-enabled location to the DAV handler.  Unfortunately, this is not a good idea, because it means that CGI scripts that use the POST handler will always fail.  I have reverted that change.			Ryan Bloom	Sander Holthaus

It seems to happen the following (GET / HTTP/1.0) without negotiation:  run_fixup: ->mod_usertrack: spot_cookie ->mod_dir: search and find index.html using sub_req_lookup_uri, which runs a  fixup itself (->next spot_cookie)   ->internal_fast_redirect -> apr_table_overlay(r->headers_out,                                                  rr->headers_out)                                 ^^ two cookies here ^^  mod_negotiation instead (in case of index.html.var) does an additional normal  internal_redirect to the negotiated resource, which drops the old stuff and  cooks (not only) its own cookie.  right?

13511	null	CLOSED		Dave Dyer	1034278680000	1083840787000		Apache misbehaves if log file reaches 2GB If the error log can't be written, it appears that any process that tries to write to the error log is quietly terminated.   This can  cause serious errors where no serious errors existed.  Suggest 1) 'quiet termination' should be noisier, to attract attention. 2) there should be some sort of overall status information that could be routinely monitored for such 'alarm' conditions as the inability to make log file entries.  Here are some details from an event that led to this report.  The 'symptom' was that some scripted emails arrived blank.  There was no other indication of a problem, but once someone complained about the blank emails, It was  noticed that the error_log was 2GB in size and had stopped growing due to  maximum file size.  The web site was otherwise operating normally, except that errors weren't being logged.  Further investigation showed that a CGI subprocess invlolved in sending the  email was routinely emitting a warning message, which was logged, and the inability to log the warning caused the process to terminate.  Since the main  thread emitting HTML didn't fail, the user's screen didn't indicate any  problem.	Hmmm... I'm not really an expert in this, but it seems it is the CGI script that needs to guard against the out-of-space condition, not Apache. What could Apache do to prevent this?  No, the CGI is not even aware that a log file is being written; it is merely emitting some text on stderr.  For its pains, it gets terminated by apache.   Again, I'm not an expert in this, but Apache is just attaching the stderr pipe to  the error log.  If this pipe can't be written, the OS is probably just sending SIGPIPE to your CGI.  If you CGI doesn't handle that, it will die.  I don't see anything that Apache could do about this. Apache can't be doing anything as simpleminded as you suggest, because it is running many concurrent CGI threads. So the fate of this particular thread could be better.  Secondarily, as I suggested, apache must know that globally speaking, it's log file is not working.  There should be some alert procedure - it shouldn't just allow shit to happen until someone notices the mess and deduces the cause and cure.   I don't understand your first paragraph at all.  How does multiple CGI processes have anything to do with it?  They are all handled identically.  Regarding behaving better when the error log is full, that seems kind of absurd to me.  Apache writes errors to the the error log. If it can't do that, what is it supposed to do?  Write to another log file?  What if that log can't be written to?  Send a message to your pager?  Walk down the hall and tap you on the shoulder? ;-)  At some point it needs to be the administrator's responsibility to maintain available system resources.    In this case, this minimum requirement is that a 500 error (with no   additional 'helpful information') should be sent to the client of this   terminated script.  Re: multiple CGI processes - it their output was tee'd directly from stderr to a log file, the output from multiple processes would be  chaotically interspersed.  That in itself would be a problem. The  output from DTDOUT is clearly handled individually, so why not STDERR?  For the momement, lets separate the question of what happened to  this particular CGI from that happens in general.  1) For this particular CGI, a warning message caused the process to terminate, effectively turning friendly glitch audit trail into a black hole.  Clearly  not a desirable outcome.  2) From the viewpoint of apache as a whole, if log files are not being maintained and processes are being killed randomly, the system as a whole is in serious jeopordy.  Perhaps Apache should shut down (which will surely get someone's attention) but at the very least there should be an emergency channel of some sort throug which apache reports serious internal problems.  The standard log files are not a good place for this, because apache's (rare we hope) internal problems would be lost in mountains of routine log data.  Consider the current case; Apache knows exactly what is wrong, and can/should tell the sysop 'error log can't be written'.    Consider the current behavior as a debugging problem 'my email arrived blank'.  Which would you rather deal with?  This is the 2GB log file problem :(  32-bit builds of Apache (1.3 or 2.0) don't currently handle 'large' files.  Apache child processes will die trying to write logs which have reached 2GB in size.  The obvious place to report the proble is -- you guessed it -- the log file that we can't write to.  The current message to users is that they need to use log rotation to keep the size well under 2GB.  Yes this sucks, yes it will eventually get fixed, yes there are issues that make it problematic to enable on some platforms (including Linux).  Sorry :(  *** Bug 20160 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Yeah, you can improve the failure mode for this problem by setting SIGXFSZ (the signal which kills the process when it write()s past 2gb) to SIG_IGN.  It's a trivial change - I'll submit a patch. Fixed in HEAD by allowing >2Gb log files on platforms which have this limit; will be proposed for backport for the next 2.0 release. *** Bug 28968 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 30170 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 33937 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Dave Dyer	Jeff Trawick	Joe Orton	Joshua Slive	Will Rowe

See the thread on the Apache Users mailing list archive for more information and a reproducible test-case and verifications on Linux and Windows.  Quoting Robert Andersson: As I see it, the 'bug' in mod_autoindex would be that it doesn't URI-escape the filename before sending it to the sub_request function. A quick note. After a little further research, I see that the 'bug' is rather in server/request.c/ap_sub_req_lookup_dirent(), which calls ap_process_request_internal() with r->uri set to the plain unescaped filename, which can result in ap_process_request_internal() returning  'not found' or 'bad request', eg:  '/xxx%0.txt' -> bad request '/xxx%20.txt' -> not found  I have been able to fix this behaviour. I'll be back later. Fixed in 2.1 and proposed for backport into the 2.0 stable branch.  Thanks for your report and thanks for using Apache!			Andr?? Malo	Leif W	Robert Andersson
13609	null	CLOSED		Joseph Senulis	1034609820000	1042815060000		apachectl does not work under Tru64 Unix In Apache 2.0.40, there was a change in the bin/apachectl file which added the follwoing line:  ULIMIT_MAX_FILES='ulimit -S -n "ulimit -H -n"'  I tried to build Apache 2.0.42 and 2.0.43, and both had the same problem in that this statement did not run.  Specifically, as root, I could not issue the command:  ulimit -H -n  This is not a legitimate Bourne shell command in Tru64 5.1 or 5.1A.  The command:  ulimit -h -n  does do what I believe was desired, so I have modified my copy of apachectl to work around the problem.  The man page for sh under Tru64 says that -H is used  for setting, not getting the hard ulimit.  I don't know if this is true for all unixes or just Tru64.  This looks to be generated by configure.  Thanks.  --Joe	I'm a little confused at the symptom you saw.  I can see the ulimit command fail on Tru64 when using /bin/sh, but after the command fails at configure time I end up with this in apachectl, so apachectl doesn't try to do ulimit.  ULIMIT_MAX_FILES=''  Any ideas why we are seeing something different? Created an attachment (id=4439) configuration log which resulted in bad apachectl file  I definitely got the following in apachectl:  UMIMIT_MAX_FILES='ulimit -S -n "ulimit -H -n"'  I did not get any errors when running configure.  I have attached the configuration log from when I created this.  I will make some time to rerun configure with better logging to see if I can get better info. OK, I'm confused too.  I rebuilt Apache and I still get the problem.  When I run /bin/sh by hand on that computer, I definitely get an error when I try to run  ulimit -H -n  The configure also is running /bin/sh, but the script did not get an error when executing the line   if TMP_ULIMIT="ulimit -H -n" && ulimit -S -n $TMP_ULIMIT ; then  and as a result does not set APACHECTL_ULIMIT to null.  When I try running this code fragment by hand I get an error.  I will attach config.log and config.status.  I also piped stdout and stderr from the configure into configure.log.  I will keep checking here to see what I can find, but any suggestions would be appreciated.  Created an attachment (id=4466) config.log from rebuild  Created an attachment (id=4467) config.status from rebuild  Created an attachment (id=4468) stdout and stderr from configure, with set -v -x added at start  Regardless of why configure fails to realize that the standard ulimit command won't work on your box yet configure does realize it won't work on my box, the fix is the same: check for Tru64 and substitute the right command rather than trying the default.  The fix has been committed to Apache 2.1 development tree.  If nobody complains  about the change, I'll ask for it to be considered for merging into Apache  2.0.45.  Thanks for your report/debug assistance, and thanks for using Apache!  I have done some more poking about.  The configure script changes the shell  from Bourne to Korn, in (I believe) the line:  exec '$CONFIG_SHELL' '$0' ${1+'$@'}  which restarts the script using the Korn shell.  At that point, it eventually  gets to the line:  if TMP_ULIMIT="ulimit -H -n" && ulimit -S -n $TMP_ULIMIT ; then  and is still running the Korn shell.  The argument "ulimit -H -n" is perfectly  valid in T64 Korn shell, so the configure script would not assign null to  APACHECTL_ULIMIT.  What I don't understand is why you were seeing differently.   Presumably, when you tested this, configure did not restart itself with the  Korn Shell?  In any event, there is a discrepancy between T64 ksh and sh, in  that -H is valid in ksh, but -h should be used in sh.  *** Bug 16415 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Jeff Trawick	Joseph Senulis

As simple as it is to patch and move on, it   seems like the sort of exception we should be looking for in the test   suite.  I'll see what we can do about that, since we aught to prove    the old module wrong (from the perl-testsuite), apply the patch and    confirm it solves the bug complete.   Ok, I tested this a bit further with 1.3.26 and 2.0.40 and made a perl CGI that can be used for testing (attaching it in a jiffy).  The script contains test URLs, expected results and results for the two tested servers.  1.3.26 passed all tests, while 2.0.40 failed 3 of them; 2) and 6) supposedly because of the bug described here, and 9) since it doesn't seem to check if the query string after '?' is empty, but passes an empty string.

If you are concerned about the 'no cache - add cache_in filter and DECLINE' part of the message, that is perfectly normal. This simply indicates that the cache handler has noticed that new, cacheable content is arriving. It inserts the cache_in filter into the filter chain so that the caching code can store the new content as it flows through, but it returns 'declined' to indicate that the cache handler didn't process the response.  I'm going to wait a few days for a clarification on this. If there isn't something I've missed here then I'll go ahead and close this PR at that point. Having received no response to the contrary, I have to assume that this was not actually a problem after all. I'm closing it now. It can be re-opened if someone disagrees. Hi, sorry for the delay. Well, the error is right here: --- [Fri Oct 25 18:59:00 2002] [debug] proxy_http.c(221): proxy: HTTP connecting  http://10.0.0.2/proxy:http://10.0.0.2/index.html to 10.0.0.2:80 ---  it tries to get the URL http://10.0.0.2/proxy:http://10.0.0.2/index.html,  generating errors. it only happens when using mod_proxy with mod_rewrite. it  looks like mod_rewrite appends the 'http://10.0.0.2/proxy:' string, in the  example, but *only* when the document expires from the cache.  Does the server return an error to the client or does the server succeed in retrieving and returning the page from the proxy machine? In other words, is it just a logging issue or does it actually fail to retrieve the page after it expires?  I don't see a log entry indicating that the page isn't found, and the only entry in the log from the cache code indicates that it is inserting the cache_in_filter to handle the page returned from the proxy.  Thanks for any additional info you can provide. in all these requests, the server returns an error to the client.

In this situation, multiple Listen directives are required, as shown below:  Listen 0.0.0.0:80 Listen [::]:0  Apache does not currently detect this, so the Listen statements must be edited manually by the administrator.	FYI...  Here are some notes I threw together describing what I think is the proper  solution.  Part of that is to provide multiple Listen statements.  http://www.apache.org/~trawick/v4mapped.html  Any comments are appreciated.  Just committed was a change to add --[enable|disable]-v4-mapped configure option which defaults to --disable-v4-mapped on freebsd5*|netbsd|openbsd, which will result in two listen statements in the default config file.  The default ssl config is not automatically generated, so comments were added to that describing the two necessary Listen directives. 			Jeff Trawick
14147	null	CLOSED		Dan Good	1036097460000	1036121171000		patch for filename truncation bug in ap_directory_walk Apache will, in some cases, truncate the last character of a filename causing it to either not find the file or serve the wrong file.  Below are steps to reproduce the bug, part of a gdb debugging session showing the code that causes the bug, and a small patch to fix the bug.  This is probably the cause for the symptoms seen in bug #10687.  I first encountered the problem when a customer was trying to do a virtual include of a file via mod_include SSI.  The error log consistently showed apache failing to find a file whose name was one character shorter than the desired file.  Here is an example.      $ cd ~user04      $ cat html/1/index.shtml     <html>     <body>     test<br>     <!--#include virtual='../2/in.html' -->     </body>     </html>      $ cat html/2/in.html     This is in.html      $ wget -q -O - http://sf1000.registeredsite.com/~user04/1/     <html>     <body>     test<br>     [an error occurred while processing this directive]     </body>     </html>      $ cat /usr/apache/logs/error.log.1036095600      [Thu Oct 31 15:20:12 2002] [user04] [error] [client 209.35.187.200]      (2)No such file or directory: file permissions deny server access:      /home/r/t/user04/html/2/in.htm     [Thu Oct 31 15:20:12 2002] [user04] [error] [client 209.35.187.200]      unable to include '../2/in.html' in parsed file      /home/r/t/user04/html/1/index.shtml       Here is part of a debugging session where the code causing the bug can be seen in action.

The code proceeds to lines 920 and 921 where the last character of the filname is truncated. Lines 920 and 921 originally served to take off a temporary slash added in lines 740-744 in an earlier pass through the loop, but the boolean variable 'temp_slash' is still true when the goto jumps back into the loop.

Does this make sense as the possible scenario?  Can you check this Dan?  Bill Bill, you're forgetting the gotos :)  I'm about to post some text to dev@httpd.     Refixed this morning in CVS.  The revised server.c is attached complete,   so you don't end up with the hack-around still sitting in your sources.    directory_walk should never have the goto target above the code that   it was attempting to escape from.  In fact, a minimerge3: target should   have been used -after- the uncached-merge logic.    No matter, the new sources factor out all the goto's.  Please test this   new patch thoroughly.  request.c source to follow.   Created an attachment (id=3702) httpd-2.0/server/request.c for 2.0.43, committed to 2.0.44-dev.     The final patch doesn't reset the flag, as demonstrated in the attached   patch.  It turns out our goto loop logic was terribly flawed.  The final   patch to address this bug simply eliminates the odd looping that caused   us to chop the extra character{s}.    For each DirectoryMatch (or Directory ~ path) block, we looped back over   the wrong code, causing us to chop more than a single character off the   end of the name (when expected to simply chop off the trailing slash.)    If the fix works for you, terrific.  You might also consider the correct   patch, attaching in one moment. Created an attachment (id=3711) Patch that eliminates the looping that caused the symptoms.  *** Bug 12155 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 10687 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 14860 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 15923 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Jeff Trawick	Joshua Slive	Michael Dean	Will Rowe

14376	null	CLOSED		L.C.	1036712100000	1050428689000		Date header overwritten in proxied requests It appears that mod_proxy overwrites the Date header with the local date. Mine is configured as a Reverse Proxy (have not tried the other way). The date header is in the proper format (comes from an Apache 1.3 server).  This should not happen because this way the client loses the reference for the Expires header (which passes through unmodified).  Below are two sets of response headers I tested with. The first one is the backend server accessed directly, the second is via the proxy, at about 20 seconds time difference. The time on the proxy is 2-3 minutes behind the backend's. The frontend always sets the expiration date to  same value as date.  HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2002 21:41:15 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.27 (Unix) Cache-control: no-cache Content-Length: 1924 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Expires: Thu, 07 Nov 2002 21:41:15 GMT  HTTP/1.0 200 OK Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2002 21:38:31 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.27 (Unix) Cache-control: no-cache Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Expires: Thu, 07 Nov 2002 21:41:37 GMT Via: 1.1 <proxyhostname> Connection: close	The last statement should read: 'The backend always sets the expiration date to same value as date.'     I need to refer to the docs, but your error is setting the Expires: tag   in the first place after using Cache-Control: no-cache    You can't have it both ways and you will probably confuse some caches. Ok, from RFC 2616;     The Date general-header field represents the date and time at which    the message was originated, having the same semantics as orig-date in    RFC 822. The field value is an HTTP-date, as described in section    3.3.1; it MUST be sent in RFC 1123 [8]-date format.  and     A received message that does not have a Date header field MUST be    assigned one by the recipient if the message will be cached by that    recipient or gatewayed via a protocol which requires a Date.  So, if we have a Date:, the proxy should assign that, if we have no date, we invent one.  Finally, about your Expires: tag... I strongly suggest you follow the following semantic;     An origin server [...] MAY assign an Expires value that is known,     at or before server configuration time, to be in the past (this allows     'pre-expiration' of responses without storing separate Expires values     for each resource).  which is precisely the behavior you desired.  The conclusion that the proxy must set the Date header when it has already been provided by the origin server cannot be inferred from the two paragraphs quoted (since the message is not originated on the proxy).  Using the rfc822 analogy mentioned in the text would imply a mail relay changing the Date: header as the email passes through it, even if there is one already  there that respects the format. That does not happen.  The proxy's changing of the date makes the Expires header as unreliable as the time on the proxy machine, because other than the Date header, the client has  no way to know the time reference of the origin server. That essentially makes Expires unusable for anything other than very distant times in the future (depending on how much the proxy time is off).  Having both Cache-Control: no-cache and Expires is perfectly valid/legal. 'no-cache' does not mean 'do not cache/store'; it means 'revalidate on every request'. Expires refers to content freshness which is often a separate issue.  Some applications may be able to predict expiration times and may still want to see all [validation] requests. Some caches (think CDNs like Akamai or bookmark revalidation services) may use the combination to optimize their [caching] decisions.  Cache-control overrides Expires:     The presence of an Expires header field with a date value of some    time in the future on a response that otherwise would by default be    non-cacheable indicates that the response is cacheable, unless    indicated otherwise by a Cache-Control header field (section 14.9).  Since this is not really realted to Date header changes, I will  probably submit a separate bug report.  According to proxy_http.c this is the only code that touches the date field:    \t      if ((buf = apr_table_get(r->headers_out, 'Date')) != NULL) {   \t\tapr_table_set(r->headers_out, 'Date',                                    ap_proxy_date_canon(p, buf));   \t      }                                               What it does is try and parse the date provided using ap_proxy_date_canon(). This tries to parse the date, but if it fails to parse the date, the date is transferred through unaltered.  If the date is being overwritten, it is likely to be happening inside the Apache core, and not mod_proxy. I have updated the component to reflect this.  Found the problem: inside modules/http/http_protocol.c the date is being set to the current time, and the contents of the output headers array is ignored in the case of the date header. The attached patch fixes this.  Created an attachment (id=5840) Patch to fix for v2.0.46-dev  Created an attachment (id=5841) Patch this time without compiler warnings!

14451	null	CLOSED		Bruno Wolff III	1037030760000	1045528746000		Using mod_deflate on an internally redirected request results in an extra 20 byte gzip header appended to the response. When I filter CGI output with the DEFLATE filter (with or without also using INCLUDES) I get a content-length header with a byte count off by 20 bytes. The ones I have observed have been low in GET requests and high in HEAD requests (for the latter a count of 20 was returned even though there was no body data returned). You can see a sample of this using http://www.schroepl.net/cgi-bin/http_trace.pl to fetch the page http://wolff.to/area/G_776.html . I currently am not compressing output for browsers that supply the string MSIE in the user-agent header. I am using a CVS version of 2.0.44 from last week.	I saw that some other fixes to mod_deflate were applied recently and retested on current CVS and the problem still exists. Is there some additional information that I can provide that would help you guys confirm this bug? I have tried looking through the bucket passing code in the past when reporting mod_deflate bugs and wasn't able to understand enough to be able to spot where the errors are. I see that you are possible going to change the status of mod_deflate to be a normal module instead of experimental. I have found that people running IE 5.0 and IE 6.0 have been having a lot of problems viewing pages generate by cgi scripts and filtered by mod_deflate. I suspect that the problem is related to the content-length header issue, but I am not absolutely sure of this. If confirming this would help increase the priority on figuring this problem out, I could try using mod_headers to strip the content-length headers and see if that solves the problem for the IE users. However, I have to ask others to do the testing and it might take a few days before I get help after I have some modified pages for them to look at. Supplying the simplest testcase you can come up with that shows the problem would be very helpful.  I've tried to duplicate the problem with GET requests on current code but I haven't been successful.  I haven't looked at the HEAD issue yet.  I think I have figured out enough so that you should be able to reproduce the problem. The missing part is that I do an internal redirect and that is needed to make the problem show up. http://wolff.to/area/htaccess (no period) with show the .htaccess file. The first line (the filter list) and the last line (the relevant redirect) should be all that matters. http://wolff.to/area/test.pl , http://wolff.to/area/test.cgi and http://wolff.to/area/test.html all point to the same file. The first will give you the source, the second will work correctly and the third has a content-length header off by 20. However, note that in the second case the file is 20 bytes longer. I looked at the difference between the compressed output returned by test.cgi and test.html and it appears that test.html has an extra 20 bytes of what appears to be a gzip header tacked on to the end. I also updated to use the latest cvs yesterday so I am now running a 2.1.0 version of httpd. The HEAD and GET problems appear to be separate. The extra 20 bytes get added when there is an internal redirect (using mod_rewrite) and both the new and old extension are subject to mod_deflate filtering. I added another rewrite rule to the htaccess file and a test.txt file accessible through a redirect as test1.txt to illustrate this case. I will see if I can do a better job of isolating the bad content-length header returns on HEAD requests. I figured out what was happenning with the odd content-length header values on HEAD requests. The short story is that it isn't a bug. The script I was using only returns a content-type header on HEAD requests (this is probably broken behavior) to save doing database lookups that won't be used. Even though the body is 0 bytes, it still gets gzip encoded and this encoding takes up 20 bytes. That is why there is a content-length of 20. So the only issue is the extra 20 bytes being tacked on to the body of requests that have a filtered (by mod_deflate) on both the initial and final filename extensions. This is sort of a related note. Normally a content-lenght header isn't sent when an includes filter is used or when the output comes from a cgi script. However if mod_deflate is used, then a content-length header is included for either or both of these cases. I tried using addoutputfilterbytype to see if that would work around the problem, but it didn't help. Is there anything else I can do to help get this bug verified? I think I have included enough information for someone to check on it, but haven't heard back either way since figuring out that combining internal redirects and mod_deflate exhibits the problem. I was able to find a configuration that avoided the problem in my setup. I have changed things to reflect this and have removed some of the test pages I had up. The successful way to handle *.html URLs that were redirected to *.cgi URLs (with internal redirects) so that the output was passed both though INCLUDES and DEFLATE without getting the extra 20 bytes of gzip header or messing *.html files that aren't redirected is: AddOutputFilter INCLUDES;DEFLATE .html AddOutputFilter DEFLATE .txt .pl .sql .cgi AddOutputFilterByType INCLUDES text/html This is now all being done at the top level of my document root. Previously there was an addoutputfilter for .cgi files that only specified DEFLATE at the top level and this was overridden in a subdirectory (area) where cgi output was to get passed through both INCLUDES and DEFLATE. This may be related to the problem I was having as reduplicating the issue with the output filter directives only at the top level doesn't seem to work. By using the addoutputfilterbytype directive I can just do INCLUDES processing for cgi output that returns text/html (as opposed to text/plain) and don't need to have diferent rules in different directories. So, I am not completely sure what is needed to make the problem show up. I was able to get the problem to occur with just plain html files (no cgi script) subject to a redirect in the subdirectory. I am asking one of my users to see if this fixes the problem with accessing the pages with IE. It turns out my new configuration didn't fix things. http://www.schroepl.net/cgi-bin/http_trace.pl started reporting a data returned size that matched the content length header, but according to my access_log another 20 bytes were actually sent. I noticed this when I got a report back from an IE user that they still couldn't get compressed responses to work. So what I think changed was the testing service, not the content being served. I think I have something that will point out where I am seeing the problem. In mod_deflate.c there is code to not due compression for subrequests. I think this check should be extended to not do it for internal redirects. (I am not sure why the check that the request doesn't already have a gzip encoding doesn't catch this.) I checked r->next to see if there will be more processing after this request is completed. I am not sure this is correct, because the .h that defines record_rec has a comment that this link refers to external requests. I suspect that that is a typo. Anyway the patch seems to work for my problem. I will let you know if this fixes the IE problem when I hear back from the person who has been having problems with compressed responses. The diff versus mod_deflate.c follows: *** mod_deflate.c.orig  Sun Dec 22 13:53:19 2002 --- mod_deflate.c       Sun Dec 22 13:36:55 2002 *************** *** 260,266 ****           const char *encoding, *accepts;            /* only work on main request/no subrequests */ !         if (r->main) {               ap_remove_output_filter(f);               return ap_pass_brigade(f->next, bb);           } --- 260,266 ----           const char *encoding, *accepts;            /* only work on main request/no subrequests */ !         if (r->main || r->next) {               ap_remove_output_filter(f);               return ap_pass_brigade(f->next, bb);           } I heard back from the IE user who was having problems and now that there aren't an extra 20 bytes being tacked on to compressed responses, things are working OK. I'll try to have a closer look at the problem and the patch these days, but one word anyway:  sending different headers for GET and HEAD is wrong. You should _not_ handle both methods not differently. Just send the content regardless of the method. Apache will do the right thing and discard the body if neccessary. But he's able to maintain the Content-length header (or TRansfer-Encoding). Thanks for looking at this! While working on this issue I did figure out that suppressing the content for the head method was wrong. I haven't gotten around to changing the code yet, but I plan to. The original idea was to save resources by not doing database calls if the content was going to be thrown away anyway, but it turned out that keeps the head method from being as useful as it should. I also got confused by this as I was expecting the content-length to be zero since there was no body, not realizing that a gzip'd version of an empty content takes up 20 bytes. Get requests do seem to be broken though. And since mod_deflate checks to make sure it isn't run twice, I am pretty sure there is something wrong where I have patched the code. (Especially since it fixes things for me.) I am just not sure that the fix is really correct for all cases. strange ...  Seems to happen only when redirecting to the cgi-handler. Can someone confirm or disprove this?  Thanks anyway for your patience with us :) errr, forget my last comment. I did the wrong tests ;-)  However, your patch worked around the actual problem, it did not solve it. The problem was that after finalizing the (redirected) request, the original request sent an(other) EOS bucket down the filter chain, which caused mod_deflate to init zlib and exit zlib with the result of 20 extra bytes.  The following patch should solve the problem entirely: <http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/server/util_filter.c.diff?r1=1.94&r2=1.95>  It's proposed for backport and may be in the next 2.0 release.  Thanks again for your patience and your detailed reports! I removed my patched mod_deflate and resynced with current CVS and retested for the problem. It seems to be fixed now. Thanks! FYI: The fix will be in 2.0.45. *** Bug 17629 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 14678 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 14678 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Andr??

Basically the problem is, if you have:  ProxyPass /foo http://newserver/foo ProxyPassReverse /foo http://newserver/foo  Then an SSI of:  <!--#include virtual='/foo/bar'-->  _will_ be proxied. If instead of ProxyPass you use:  RewriteRule /foo(.*) http://newserver/foo$1 [P]  then the above SSI is _not proxied_. This is because of:          /*          *  Ignore this rule on subrequests if we are explicitly          *  asked to do so or this is a proxy-throughput or a          *  forced redirect rule.          */         if (r->main != NULL &&             (p->flags & RULEFLAG_IGNOREONSUBREQ ||              p->flags & RULEFLAG_PROXY          ||               p->flags & RULEFLAG_FORCEREDIRECT    )) {             continue;         }  in mod_rewrite. If you comment out the RULEFLAG_PROXY, it works as expected.  I'm not sure of the consequences this has. Can anyone comment on the reasoning  behind this?   I believe this also applies to httpd-2.0, but I haven't actually compiled it  yet.	This doesn't work perfectly, I've discovered. Take the follwoing setup:  ## relevant conf directives DirectoryIndex index.html index.php RewriteRule ^/(.*/.php)$ http://localhost:8888/$1 [P] ##  $DocRoot/blah/ contains: index.php and test.html  Now...*without* patching mod_rewrite, a request for http://www.domain.org/blah/ will return index.php just fine, and it will be properly proxied over to localhost:8888. And, as this bug points out, if test.html just contains <!--#include virtual='index.php'-->, requests for it return the unparsed source of index.php, which is incorrect.  But if you remove the one line from mod_rewrite, allowing proxy requests in subrequests, the situation reverses. The SSI part works properly, but requests for /blah/ give you a directory index instead of the output of index.php.  So this patch doesn't do exactly the right thing.   I've done some more digging and think I've come a little closer to the real source of the problem:  mod_dir makes subrequests for each of its potential index file names until it finds one to return. Line 165 of mod_dir.c is this:  if (rr->status == HTTP_OK && S_ISREG(rr->finfo.st_mode)) {  So, for mod_dir to return an index file the subrequest has to be HTTP_OK and it must be a regular file. This works fine with the unpatched mod_rewrite, because it will return HTTP_OK and the file will be there -- even if the server is going to end up proxying it in the end.  But, if you patch mod_rewrite then you'll still get the HTTP_OK, but rr->filename will have been changed to start with 'proxy:', so S_ISREG() will fail.   Which leads to this solution:  change the call to ap_sub_req_lookup_uri on line 163 of mod_dir.c to ap_sub_req_lookup_file. ap_sub_req_lookup_file doesn't do the URI translation, so it skips mod_rewrite in the subrequest. But then mod_dir still does an internal redirect, which in turn *does* do the URI translation, so everything works out in the end.  With these changes both mod_include and mod_dir do the right thing when they are dealing with a file proxied via mod_rewrite+mod_proxy. I'll attach a patch which changes both parts. Created an attachment (id=3973) One line fix to each: mod_dir & mod_rewrite  I'm going through the bug db to make sure patches are findable.  Please see  http://httpd.apache.org/dev/patches.html  Another solution to this problem is to utilize the proxy: moniker instead of  [P} to invoke the proxy client.  [P] as you have pointed out invokes the proxy client but does not continue with  additional includes on the invoked page.  Wheras the proxy: moniker is invoked in the file mapping handler which contiues  with additional ssi requests.  Example: RewriteRule ^(.*) proxy:http://host/$1  This assumes that mod_proxy is installed and configured correctly!  The other benefit is that additional SSI requests will continue to be processed  on the calling page.  Fixed in 2.1.  Thanks for the report and thanks for using Apache.			Andr??

14921	null	CLOSED		Julian Reschke	1038475260000	1043861374000		reported entity tags differ between HEAD/GET and PROPFIND For the filesystem backend, HEAD/GET return weak entitiy tags, while PROPFIND (DAV:getetag) returns the same tokens with the leading 'W/' removed.	(likely cause: moddav duplicates code from ap_make_etag in http_protocol.c  instead of reusing it directly -- etag computation probably should be done in  one single place) This is not really a bug per se.  What happens is that we generate a weak ETag when the request is too close to the modification time of the file (as dictated by RFC 2616, ETags should have 60-second resolutions).  After that second has elasped and the file hasn't changed, that weak entity tag would be made strong.  Creating a weak tag in mod_dav_fs isn't always desirable since it isn't keyed to a request - therefore all of its entity tags should be strong rather than weak.  However, RFC 2616 explicitly calls out strong entity comparison and weak entity comparison functions.  Currently, mod_dav only uses strong entity comparison.  So, I modified mod_dav to do weak entity comparison instead.  See modules/dav/main/util.c r1.45.  This has been proposed for the next stable release of httpd-2.0.  Thanks for using Apache! *** Bug 16451 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I'm not sure that I agree with the analysis. First of all, RFC2616 doesn't  define a specific resolution for etags.  (all this probably only applies to the fs backend)  The issue here seems to be that the resource's etag starts it's life as a weak  one, and then turns into a strong etag after some delay. This works fine if you  discover an already existing resource using GET/HEAD/PROPFIND, but leads to  ugly results if a client takes the entity tag returned by a PUT as validator  for subsequent PUT operations (because upon PUT, the entity tag returned is  always a weak one, because it's 'fresh').  As far as the If-* headers defined in RFC2616 are concerned (not the If:  defined in RFC2518), strong comparison should be applied to etags (end of para  13.3.3). This is why I believe the only workable solution here is to do weak entity comparison for the If: header.  mod_dav must be able to handle weak entity tags for its conditional headers because the entity tag might be promoted from a weak to a strong one at any time (given rules of 13.3.3).  Note that using ap_make_etag is not an option since we don't have access to the original request, nor is that resource in the etag hook even related to the original resource that was requested.  (ap_make_etag has certain configurable properties that may not be correct if we are not dealing with the original resource.)  And, doing so, wouldn't solve the real problem of ETag promotion.  If 2518bis clarifies this and says that If should only have strong entity comparison, then we might want to rethink this.  Regardless, perhaps it should clarify this corner case.

To work around the issue until I eventually find the real cause, I applied the folllowing patch to my 2.0.43 source-tree:  --- ssl_engine_vars.c   2002/12/04 11:27:14     1.1 +++ ssl_engine_vars.c   2002/12/04 11:27:34 @@ -280,7 +280,8 @@      else if (ssl != NULL && strcEQ(var, 'SESSION_ID')) {          char buf[SSL_SESSION_ID_STRING_LEN];          SSL_SESSION *pSession = SSL_get_session(ssl); -        result = apr_pstrdup(p, SSL_SESSION_id2sz( +       if (pSession) +               result = apr_pstrdup(p, SSL_SESSION_id2sz(                                  SSL_SESSION_get_session_id(pSession),                                  SSL_SESSION_get_session_id_length(pSession),                                  buf, sizeof(buf)));   I'm not sure whether this is an issue with mod_ssl, my connection-handler or openssl. As the patch is simple enough, I would recommend to apply it to the offcial tree in any case.  cheers,  /ol	Ah, I just found a repro case for SSL_get_session returning NULL: when serving the 'you sent a plain HTTP request over an SSL connection' error message.  Thanks for the patch! It's committed to 2.1 and will be proposed for backport for 2.0.			Joe Orton

We have this friendly message :  '[notice] child pid 19283 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)'  when we try to retrieve some web pages through an Apache 2.0.43 proxy running mod_cache, from a serveur returning 302 ok responses.  I looked a little bit in the code, and, I'm not a specialist, but the problem seems to be in mod_cache.c, in the cache_in_filter function, when there is a call to apr_pstrcat :  if (r->status != HTTP_OK && r->status != HTTP_NON_AUTHORITATIVE          && r->status != HTTP_MULTIPLE_CHOICES          && r->status != HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY          && r->status != HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED) {          /* RFC2616 13.4 we are allowed to cache 200, 203, 206, 300, 301 or 410           * We don't cache 206, because we don't (yet) cache partial responses.           * We include 304 Not Modified here too as this is the origin server           * telling us to serve the cached copy.          */          reason = apr_pstrcat(p, 'Response status %d', r->status); }  Commenting this line prevent us from having this problem (on this particular web-serveur) but I don't think it's really clean... ;-)  Can you look at this ?

15114	null	CLOSED		Mike Cramer	1039106760000	1074040672000		t pass Proxy Throughput on internal subrequests This is basically the same bug as #14648 for Apache 1.3. It is also in the old bug DB as PR#2074.   Three things have to change:  1) mod_rewrite has to run proxy rules in subrequests. This allows mod_include to work with the proxy rules. 2) mod_dir has to use ap_sub_req_lookup_file instead of ap_sub_req_lookup_uri. The mod_rewrite change, will break mod_dir with out this change. Basically, using _file instead of _uri avoids the rewrite rule entirely, allowing mod_dir to find the index file. 3) But mod_dir still doesn't do the entirely right thing, because of bug #15112. So apply that patch and it everything will work properly.	Created an attachment (id=4060) Fix mod_rewrite proxy bug for mod_include  Oh yea...and the code that adds the args to the subrequest when checking each file has to go again if it's changed to use ap_sub_req_lookup_file. Otherwise a request like http://domain.org/foo/?bar=1 will fail. Granted, the original logic -- that the args could be relevant to decision of which index file to use -- is good, but this seems like the lesser of two evils. I'm going through the bug db to make sure patches are findable.  Please see  http://httpd.apache.org/dev/patches.html  Another solution to this problem is to utilize the proxy: moniker instead of  [P} to invoke the proxy client.  [P] as you have pointed out invokes the proxy client but does not continue with  additional includes on the invoked page.  Wheras the proxy: moniker is invoked in the file mapping handler which contiues  with additional ssi requests.  Example: RewriteRule ^(.*) proxy:http://host/$1  This assumes that mod_proxy is installed and configured correctly!  The other benefit is that additional SSI requests will continue to be processed  on the calling page.   Fixed in 2.1.  Thanks for the report and thanks for using Apache.			Andr??

15207	null	RESOLVED		Phil Gregory	1039485480000	1123257749000		mod_proxy alters URIs when acting as a reverse proxy When a URI passes through mod_proxy, either via ProxyPass or a proxying RewriteRule, mod_proxy appears to be decoding percent escaped characters before passing the URI on to the destination server.  (So, for example, if the original URI contains a '%2B', the destination server will see a '+'.)  This is contrary to RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1), which says 'A transparent proxy MUST NOT rewrite the 'abs_path' part of the received Request-URI when forwarding it to the next inbound server, except as noted above to replace a null abs_path with '/'.' (section 5.1.2).  In addition, it breaks a CGI I'm using.  :)  As further information, the decoding seems to be recursive to a degree.  '%252B' is also converted into '+', but '%25252B' merely becomes '%252B'.	A reverse proxy doesn't need to be transparent. It may be as well a caching proxy, that approached the backend server only if it doens't have a fresh copy of the requested object. There fore, it MAY alter the URL. However, there is a bug in this alteration: In the reverse proxy case, unescaping is done twice. In the first   unesacping, the core does this for any non-proxy request. However, this is done before reverse proxy requests are identified by matching the URL with ProxyPass directives. Therefore, the second unescaping, in the function ap_proxy_canonenc in proxy_util.c, should be done only for a standard proxy, and not for a reverse proxy, and the line  if (isenc && ch == '%') {  (proxy_util.c:206 in httpd_2.0.45) should be replaced by  if (isenc == PROXYREQ_PROXY && ch == '%') { *** Bug 24873 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 18564 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Fix now committed to HEAD (subject to review) This bug still exists as of 2.0.53. The suggested patch in proxy_util.c from Zvi Har'El, listed below, corrects the problem for me:  if (isenc == PROXYREQ_PROXY && ch == '%') {  To reproduce the bug, I setup a Reverse Proxy and use the following urls for testing:  http://1.2.3.4/%\t\t-Returns bad request http://1.2.3.4/%25\t\t-Works http://1.2.3.4/proxy/%\t\t-Returns bad request http://1.2.3.4/proxy/%25\t-Returns bad request  After the patch, the last example works properly.

15242	null	RESOLVED		Taisuke Yamada	1039538760000	1129680320000		mod_cgi prevents handling of OPTIONS request This is a re-submission of old bug (mod_cgi/PR#4490, 1999) that was once  confirmed but was lost for some unknown reason (probably during transition to  new bug database?).  The problem resides in following code in mod_cgi.c:      if (r->method_number == M_OPTIONS) {         /* 99 out of 100 CGI scripts, this is all they support */         r->allowed |= (1 << M_GET);         r->allowed |= (1 << M_POST);         return DECLINED;     }  This code obviously prevents userland CGI to handle OPTIONS request. Because of this code, I've been unable to release/distribute CGI-based WebDAV provider script as WebDAV protocol requires service endpoint to handle OPTIONS request properly.  This same report was once submitted to apache-bugdb list in 1999 and seems to have been confirmed and almost got accepted. You can read how last conversation went in the following URL:    http://www.geocrawler.com/mail/thread.php3?subject=mod_cgi%2F4490% 3A+mod_cgi+prevents+handling+of+OPTIONS+requests&list=192  It seems the last piece needed to get the fix done is a submission of a patch, and here I'm submitting it. You can download the patch from    http://www.imasy.or.jp/~tai/temp/mod_cgi.c.patch  This patch will add 'ScriptTrapOptions (on|off)' directive, which allows user to control whether CGI script will handle OPTIONS request or not.  Just FYI, during googling, I also found Zope people is also hit by this bug. In fact, author of the patch below is the one who have submitted last bug report on this issue.    http://www.zope.org/Members/Brian/Misc/mod_cgi_webdav_patch.html  His patch simply removes above code block, whereas mine adds new diretive to control the behavior.  If this patch gets accepted, I will also submit a report for apache-2.0, as mod_cgi.c in 2.0 also has this code.	Created an attachment (id=4116) Patch to configure whether userland CGI could handle OPTIONS request.  Created an attachment (id=4117) Patch to configure whether userland CGI could handle OPTIONS request.  I'm going through the bug db to make sure patches are findable.  Please see  http://httpd.apache.org/dev/patches.html  Created an attachment (id=11102) Fixed for the Windows Update problem  Just a thought -- requiring extra configuration will be onerous for some users (e.g., those at certain  hosting providers). Rather than adding a configuration directive, why not require the script that wants  to handle OPTIONS to just emit an Apache-Specified HTTP header that gets consumed?  E.g.,  print 'Status: 200 OK' print 'Handling-OPTIONS: 1' print 'Allow: GET, POST' ... Did you ever submit a report for 2.0? Can't seem to find anything, and 2.0.53 seems to have the same  problem. Hmm, never mind the previous suggestion; if the script had side effects, they'd still take place, which  won't be good. Wow, it's been long time since I submitted this one...  No, I haven't submitted patch for 2.0. At that time, 2.0 was not really for production, so I simply waited for 1.3 patch to get in.  It 2005 now, so maybe I should push this patch for 2.0 - I guess developers are more active on 2.0 than on 1.3.  I'd just like to add that it's been awhile and it would be nice if the patch was accepted. Also known as     http://archive.apache.org/gnats/4490  This misfeature was supposed to be deleted almost immediately following its addition to the server, as described in  <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/199608.mbox/%3c9608132318.aa12603@paris.ics.uci.edu%3e>  Yep, that's Aug 1996.  In fact, I thought that I had deleted it, and if this issue had been under 'core' I would have noticed it a long long time ago. Oh well...  The block has now been deleted from all active branches of httpd (1.3.35, 2.0.56, 2.1+).  Thanks for sending in the more complicated patches, but I feel that CGI scripts should be able to handle all methods by now (or be fixed to do so properly).  ....Roy 			Bayle Shanks	Jeff Trawick	Mark Nottingham	Roy T.

Now, if I replace the include of the CGI script with a direct include of /foo.html, the result is much more reasonable:  --- dozer% cat test-apache2-redir2.shtml <!--#include virtual='/foo.html' --> Got to end! dozer% nc dozer 8763 GET /test-apache2-redir2.shtml HTTP/1.1 Host: dozer.ironplanet.com:8763  HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2003 19:22:29 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.44 (Unix) mod_fastcgi/mod_fastcgi-SNAP-0210222112 Accept-Ranges: bytes Connection: close Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1  5 hiya  d  Got to end!  0  --- I'd expect to see exactly the same output whether or not there's an internal redirect in the middle of the server-side processing of the .shtml file.

15571	null	CLOSED		Christopher M. Tan	1040397000000	1070973885000		No WWW-Authenticate header returned in 401 message Overview Description:  No WWW-Authenticate header is returned when access to a URI indicated in  the 'Destination:' header of a request fails authentication.  Steps to Reproduce:  1. Try copying a file from a normal area to a password-protected area without  supplying any authentication information (I used http://test.webdav.org/dav as  my normal area, and http://test.webdav.org/auth-basic as my password-protected  area).  Note: 'normal area' refers to an area not requiring authorization.  Actual Results:  The copy failed and a '401 Unauthorized' message was returned from the server.   However, the '401 Unauthorized' message did not contain a 'WWW-Authenticate'  header as the HTTP/1.1 specs mention it should.  Expected Results:  The copy should fail and a '401 Unauthorized' message should be returned from  the server containing a 'WWW-Authenticate' header.  The HTTP/1.1 specs mention  that this header *must* be included in a 401 response.  Build Date & Platform:  Apache/2.0.41-dev (Unix) DAV/2 SVN/0.14.2 (dev build) The server is running the mod_dav and mod_dav_fs modules.  Additional Builds and Platforms:  It has been mentioned that this problem occurs with Apache 1.3/mod_dav 1.0.  Additional Information:  This also occurs on a MOVE (or any request with a 'Destination' URI requiring  Authorization).  From the dav-dev mailing list: '...the 401 is being generated in an Apache 'subrequest', but the WWW-Auth header is not being promoted to the 'real' request, so it gets lost...'	It would certainly be helpful if you could try this with a more recent version of apache.  2.0.41-dev is quite old. No response from submitter.  Assuming issue is resolved. This is a real bug, there's a fix in the mod_dav 1.0 tree which can be ported over. I suspect that the fix below is what is needed.  I haven't found the mod_dav 1.0 change yet, but I found this change entry:  'if a lock fails due to authentication problems, return a 403 (Forbidden) rather than 401 (Unauthorized). this fixes an HTTP conformance issue where we returned 401 but no WWW-Authenticate response header.

15761	null	CLOSED		Thomas Linden	1041511140000	1044894804000		apache stops working after 260 requests I searched the bug database but could not find a similar entry.  My problem is as follows:  I am using FreeBSD 4.7. I compiled apache 2.0.43 out of the box (without any patches) with MPM set to 'prefork'. Compilation works and its also no problem to start the daemon.  After that I run siege (I used 'ab' as well as a self-written tool with identical results) on the apache. After 260 requests siege stopped working (it sleeped). I interrupted siege and tried it manually (telnet *.*.*.* 80 GET /). apache still responded to my connection and it did also deliver the / request. But it did not *close* the connection. I had to kill my telnet session.  My next try was to compile apache as MPM worker. For this to work correctly I applied the patches of the apache 2.0.43 freebsd-port. But the result is the very same. 260 requests are working then it stops closing connections.	For your prefork test, add --disable-threads to your configure invocation and try again, then report back whether or not it is still a problem.  make distclean && ./configure --disable-threads --whatever-else && make && make install  Anything thread-enabled with Apache or APR does not work reliably on FreeBSD.  Note that www.apache.org runs on FreeBSD 4.7 24x7 with no reliability problems. But it uses prefork MPM and --disable-threads.  In the meanwhile I found what has been the problem, and I can reproduce it:  In my config I had the following log-config entry:  CustomLog |/usr/bin/ipwebcollect accounting  The script '/usr/bin/ipwebcollect' did not exist during my tries. In the error log I found several (260 to be exact) entries that httpd could not find the program.  If I install the program or if I comment out the CustomLog line then the apache works as expected.  This behavior could be re-produced with proforker and worker (it seems to be the general behavior of apache, I think).   THe suggested fix would be to exit the httpd process if it cannot find a log pipe program, or ot could just de-activate the log-pipe if it does not exist or is not executable.   regards, Tom quick update: Apache hangs once the pipe to the logger fills in each child process. Apache 1.3 had the same problem, though something more helpful would be logged.  Some small improvement has been committed, but some infrastructure (APR) changes are in the works to improve it beyond the way it worked in Apache 1.3.  one question for you: You mentioned seeing the 260 error messages in the log.  I never saw messages in my testing prior to some changes I committed a couple of days ago.  Can you update the PR with the text of those messages please?  Thanks! Changes have been committed to Apache 2.1 (active development) to utilize new APR features for finding process creation errors on Unix.  These changes keep Apache from starting up if a piped log program doesn't exist or isn't executable. (There are some possible errors that are found out too late, but now they should result in an error message.)  I'll propose these changes for merging into Apache 2.0.x (stable tree).  Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache!  FYI...  the fix has been merged into the stable tree for inclusion in 2.0.45 *** Bug 17764 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Jeff Trawick	Lone Wolf	Thomas Linden
15859	null	RESOLVED		Co-Advisor	1041973260000	1188648756000		wrong Content-Length header is forwarded when de-chunking Looks like a possible RFC 2616 MUST violation.  Apache decodes chunked encoding correctly but forwards wrong Content-Length header which now MUST be honored since Apache removed chunked encoding. Thus, the overall result is that a compliant client would see truncated content (e.g., $100 instead of $1000) because of how Apache changed the message it was forwarding.  See attached trace for details and ways to reproduce.  Test case IDs in the trace link to human-oriented test case description and RFC quotes, if available.	Created an attachment (id=4352) test case trace  Is the following sentence correct?  'A proxy MUST remove a Content-Length header from chunked responses, in case this content length header is wrong'.  Not exactly, but very close, IMO.  The proxy MUST ignore wrong Content-Length header in chunked responses (which is what Apache is probably doing). It would be OK to forward that header, provided that the proxy does not decode chunks on-the-fly. A compliant recipient would not have a problem handling such a response (chunked encoding with wrong Content-Length header).  However, Apache decodes chunks into 'normal' (identity) encoding and forwards the response with the original (wrong) Content-Length value. While there is no specific MUST about this case, the only logical interpretation or RFC 2616 suggests that the wrong Content-Length header must be removed. Otherwise, a compliant recipient will mis-interpret the response!  If you want a one sentence summary, I would say: 'A proxy has to remove the wrong Content-Length header when forwarding a chunked response using identity encoding (i.e., when de-chunking on-the-fly).'  The problem though is that we cannot know the Content-Length is wrong until we have processed the entire request. At this point we would have already sent the Content-Length header onwards, so it's too late to fix it if it is wrong - it would require the proxy to buffer the entire request before sending it on, which is not practical.  One possible thing to do though is to remove the Content-Length header should Apache decide to send chunked encoding. This needs to be done inside the filter responsible for chunking, rather than mod_proxy.  Thoughts?  The Content-Length header is _always_ wrong when it is used together with chunking because Content-Length header is defined to represent both entity-length and the transfer-length. It is not possible to represent both with a single value when chunking is used.  Thus, only two actions would be correct, IMO:    - leave wrong Content-Length header and do NOT de-chunk    - remove wrong Content-Length header  Note that there is no need to remove Content-Length header if Apache decides to send chunked encoding. It is de-chunking that causes the problem. Is this related to: <http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21348>  If so, this bug breaks WindowsUpdate when used behind mod_proxy. Patch is linked in above bug that might be applicable. The WindowsUpdate patch you mentioned has no visible effect on this bug. Note that the patch seems to be designed to affect HEAD responses while this bug deals with GET responses.  *** Bug 31454 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 11993 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I believe that this problem relates to proxying of _all_ requests with chunked request data, not just those with a bogus Content-Length.  mod_proxy is de-chunking and removing Transfer-Encoding: chunked, forwarding a request with neither Content-Length: or Transfer-Encoding: header. This causes the downstream server to reply with error 411 'Length Required'.  Bug 11618 has a network trace showing this clearly.  Since it is not possible to send a correct Content-Length header without buffering all request data, it seems to me that the proper fix is to not de-chunk if the original request is chunked?  I looked briefly in the function ap_proxy_http_request in proxy_http.c. How about if the original request uses chunked transfer-encoding, then the proxied request is also send as chunked? I could try to create a patch to add that to the code, it seems not too hard:      /* send the request data, if any. */     seen_eos = 0;     do {         status = ap_get_brigade(r->input_filters, bb, AP_MODE_READBYTES,                                 APR_BLOCK_READ, HUGE_STRING_LEN);          if (status != APR_SUCCESS) {             return status;         }          /* If this brigade contain EOS, either stop or remove it. */         if (APR_BUCKET_IS_EOS(APR_BRIGADE_LAST(bb))) {             /* As a shortcut, if this brigade is simply an EOS bucket,              * don't send anything down the filter chain.              */             if (APR_BUCKET_IS_EOS(APR_BRIGADE_FIRST(bb))) {                 break;             }              /* We can't pass this EOS to the output_filters. */             e = APR_BRIGADE_LAST(bb);             apr_bucket_delete(e);             seen_eos = 1;         }          e = apr_bucket_flush_create(c->bucket_alloc);         APR_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(bb, e);          status = ap_pass_brigade(origin->output_filters, bb);         if (status != APR_SUCCESS) {             ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR, status, r->server,                          'proxy: pass request data failed to %pI (%s)',                          p_conn->addr, p_conn->name);             return status;         }         apr_brigade_cleanup(bb);     } while (!seen_eos);  You do not need to code it as httpd-2.1 has it already fixed. I also backported it in the patch of Bug 31454 which was apparently a DUPE, you can repost the patch here if you wish. I am using my patch on my server for: Fedora Core 3 httpd-2.0.52-3.1  I've been working on some improvements to the current solution in Apache 2.1.  A backport of my current 2.0 code is in a patch at http://www.apache.org/~trawick/20proxyreqbody.txt The version of this for Apache 2.1-dev is in the proxy-reqbody branch in subversion. . Any comments or additional testing would be appreciated.

I assume that some type of upload from the phone would not work through mod_proxy without this patch???? SonyEricsson P900 uses buzzword WAP-2.0 which no longer transfers WAP/WML over WSP/WTP protocols but it started using HTTP/TCP. P900 will interpret WAP-1.x WAP gateway settings sent over SMS as HTTP proxy for its WAP-2.0 (IMO incorrectly). During MMS send operation P900 will send chunked POST, current mod_proxy will dechunk it but it will not fill in the Content-Length making the final head+body POST request combo invalid.

Patched Apache httpd-2.0.54 is still sending     Content-Length: 15 when the [dechunked] content is actually 20 bytes.  Please see the attached fresh trace. Are we testing with the wrong fix?  I am taking the liberty of reopening this bug because the test case still fails (see above).  btw, the proxy-reqbody patch did not affect the response processing...  any idea what is required to have the origin server send both Content-Length *and*  Transfer-Encoding?  Sending both would violate 2616, if the proxy receives a message with both C-L and T-E it MUST ignore the C-L header per comment 3. Created an attachment (id=16218) security fix for C-L vs T-E handling (Joe Orton, CVE CAN-2005-2088)  Just FYI Joe Orton fixed: Fedora Core Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=162245 , the same as Red Hat Enterprise Bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=162244 but unfortunately these patches will disable the funtionality of: http://www.apache.org/~trawick/20proxyreqbody.txt as presented here in Comment #17 .

15993	null	RESOLVED		Detlev Vendt	1042284180000	1150964987000		HSE_REQ_MAP_URL_TO_PATH returns slashes instead of backslashes Using ISAPI ServerSupportFunction with the above constant works incorrectly if used in a virtual directory that is not located in the Apache document root  directory.  Example: Assume to have a virtual directory mapped to d:/westwind/wconnect.  If I have a script that references /wconnect ServerSupportFunction returns:  d:/program files/apache group/apache/htdocs/wconnect/  It should return:  d:/westwind/wconnect  The reason for that behavior seems to be, that the core handler resolves the  directory as a part of the document root. All other handlers (in fact mod_alias  should do this) will not have a chance to do a correct mapping.	   This may be trivial.  If you  Alias /foo c:/somepath/foo  the request /foo   will map to c:/somepath/foo, but if you  Alias /foo/ c:/somepath/foo/     (or you have unbalanced trailing slashes - that is, if the virtual path has   a trailing slash the target path must have one as well...) then the request   /foo  (or a request to map the url to that path) will fail because that   alias '/foo/' can't evaluate the shorter path '/foo'.   Thanks to Will Rowe for that hint - it works so far. A little ugly behaviour is  still there: mod_isapi puts a trailing backslash to the end of the path. With      ScriptAlias /foo/ 'c:/myfiles/foo/'  mod_isapi returns the translation      c:/myfiles/foo//  To substitute all slashes by backslashes will be a completely correct behaviour  with Win32 - including to avoid a double backslash at the end.     Note that the trailing backslash is due to the fact that there wasn't a trailing   backslash already.  Correcting the path to backslashes first will assure that   doubled-trailing slashes don't occur.     Think that we've squished this in commit 416291, but it will still not   backslash format the filename string.    Commit 416294 changes the order a bit, appends the slash first only if   it's needed, and then normalizes Win32 paths to backslash.  However,   it's platform neutral and will not normalize the path on Unix etc.    We also pay more attention to the fact that PATH_INFO is the rest of   the file path that didn't corespond to a disk file, and append it.  Whoops, closing.  See  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/arch/win32/mod_isapi.c  to obtain the source Will Rowe has posted a zipfile containing compiled mod_isapi modules which include the patch correcting this bug (for use with 2.0.58 and 2.2.2), for testing purposes.

Following configuration directives are in my httpd.conf:  #stripped off common top LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so NameVirtualHost localhost:80 NameVirtualHost localhost:801 <VirtualHost localhost:80> </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost localhost:801>  DAVLockDB logs/DavLock <Directory 'D:/apa2_0_43/htdocs'>     SetInputFilter DEFLATE     SetOutputFilter DEFLATE     DAV On     <Limit PUT POST DELETE PROPFIND PROPPATCH MKCOL COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK>         AuthName             'Fx'         AuthType             Basic         AuthUserFile         logs/passw         Require user dmitri     </Limit> </Directory> </VirtualHost>	A memory leak was fixed after 2.0.43.  Please download the latest mod_deflate (from http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/filters/mod_deflate.c) or wait for 2.0.44, then report back.  Thanks!  I've checked. Yes indeed the bug went away.  But please don't close it immediately. By learning sources I see that there  are some conditions when some additional leaks may occur again. mod_deflate does not always make a paired call to inflateEnd() after  inflateInit2() was called. It make a big concern that the leak can be  reproduced with for example a trimmed compressed part. Remember that after inflateInit2() was called zlib may allocate up to  256kb of memory and releases all in inflateEnd() only.  I checked with a 'trimmed' (e.g. wrong) compressed request. As expected Apache gets HTTP/1.1 400. But as predicted a memory leak occurs  too. Approx. 48kB for a request.  Conditions: mod_deflate mod_dav mod_dav_fs installed. PROPFIND request made with Content-encoding: gzip and content is too short  (trimmed) for example just 11 bytes. Gzipped content can never be less than 18  bytes:  #####Headers:  PROPFIND / HTTP/1.1 Content-Encoding: gzip Content-Type: text/xml; charset='utf-8' Content-Length: 11 Host: localhost:801 Accept: text/html, */* Accept-Encoding: gzip User-Agent: Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; DD Library) Depth: 1  #####Content - gzipped but trimmed, hex dump 0x1F 0x8B 0x08 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x0B 0xB3    My investigation showed that a call to inflateEnd() is missed. Occurs when  conditions above are met.  Should be fixed in modules/filters/mod_deflate.c r1.30  Thanks for using Apache HTTP Server!			Dmitri Dmitrienko	Jeff Trawick	Justin Erenkrantz

Hi all,  My web server is runing under an HP-UX 10.20 workstation (but I think it's the  same w/ other OS).  The documentation says we must following syntaxe if username have space in it :  require user Barbara Jenson  It doesn't work because Apache try to grand access to user w/ name 'Barbara' or  'Jenson'. To make it work, I have to enclose the name in double cote like :  require user 'laurent faillie'  Same problem w/ use of a redundant LDAP server :       AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap1.airius.com ldap2.airius.com/ou=People, o=Airius      require valid-user  I have to use double cote around LDAP URL :  AuthLDAPURL 'ldap://ldap2.sgp.st.com ldap1.sgp.st.com/ou=People'  or I got a misconfiguration error.

Try the patch given in   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=104321419500550&w=2 and see  if that fixes it for you.  Assuming it stops crashing, try some server restarts  and make sure you don't get any memory or file descriptor leaks.    Thanks,  Cliff  Tried the patch...it works just fine. Out of interest though, instead of (or also with) deleting the section of code  that calls the APR_RING_REMOVE define, why not just add error-checking into the  APR_RING_UNSPLICE define with a couple of 'if' statements in apr_ring.h? Example:  #define APR_RING_UNSPLICE(ep1, epN, link) do {                          /         if (APR_RING_PREV((ep1), link))                                 /                 APR_RING_NEXT(APR_RING_PREV((ep1), link), link) =       /                         APR_RING_NEXT((epN), link);                     /         if (APR_RING_NEXT((epN), link))                                 /                 APR_RING_PREV(APR_RING_NEXT((epN), link), link) =       /                         APR_RING_PREV((ep1), link);                     /    } while (0)  I tested this modification with the original mod_file_cache.c and it seems to  work as well.  Although, truth be told, I'm not entirely sure how to find out  if it has memory or fd leaks (I program mainly on win32...unix still mystifies  me at times!)  The only reason I'd suggest this is to keep this same problem  happening in potential future modules that register a cleanup call for a  simular list.  Thanks- Drew  It's a design decision we made through all of APR: we don't test for NULL.  If it's NULL, that's a bug, and it will cause a segfault.  If it segfaults, that's good, because it lets us find the bug very easily.  Another concern is that code with no bugs will never have those pointers be NULL, so non-buggy code would be paying a performance penalty just to accommodate buggy code.  Thanks for testing the patch.  I'll look for leaks myself.  --Cliff  Heh..makes sense!  Thanks for quick fix on this. Looking forward to the next release! -Drew			Cliff Woolley	John Kearns
16368	null	CLOSED		andre breiler	1043337900000	1045602082000		LoadModule order for mod_proxy and mod_rewrite It seems that some strange side effects happen if mod_rewrite is loaded before mod_proxy.  I have the following in the httpd.conf: --- snip --- LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so --- snap ---  and the following in an .htaccess (cgi-perl/.htaccess): --- snip --- RewriteEngine   On RewriteRule     (.*)    http://192.168.111.111:8080/no/$1 [P] --- snap ---  which produces an unexptected result for the request:  http://127.0.0.1/cgi-perl/blah?world=reboot . It sends an request   http://192.168.111.111:8080/no/blah%3Fworld=reboot?world=reboot .  The the two LoadModule lines are exchanged so that mod_proxy is before mod_rewrite it works as expcted (request  http://192.168.111.111:8080/no/blah?world=reboot is sent).  I don't know if this is really an bug or intended (I see it a bit as bug).	   This is a bug, in that the Apache 2.0 hook mechanisms were designed to be   independent of LoadModule order.  That said, we are sure to find a few edge   cases like the one you've identified.    Thanks for the report!  hmm, it looks like the fixup hooks of mod_rewrite and mod_proxy create the problem (both HOOK_FIRST).  first case: mod_rewrite runs first: create r->filename=proxy:http://foo/bar?baz mod_proxy runs afterwards: enode that url and append query (again): http://foo/bar%3Fbaz?baz -> proxy handler runs with the result  second case: mod_proxy fixup runs empty (no proxy request) mod_rewrite creates r->filename=proxy:http://foo/bar?baz -> proxy handler runs with the result.  We can solve this for now by hooking mod_proxy fixup explicitely before mod_rewrite. But AFAICS we need some further research to handle all the proxy stuff more clean.  Opinions? Been there, done that. It's fixed in HEAD (2.1) and proposed for backport.  Thanks for using Apache! The fix will appear in the next release (2.0.45).			Andr?? Malo	Will Rowe
16452	null	CLOSED		Julian Reschke	1043677920000	1043817360000		If header only accepts state tokens that match mod_davs lock token format Supplying a lock token which uses a format which is not known to moddav (and therefore can't possibly represent an existing lock) causes the If header validation to fail with 400 Bad Request.   Error.log shows:  The lock token uses an unknown State-token format and could not be parsed.  [400, #403]  Instead this part of the expression should just evaluate to false, and If header processing should continue. For instance, for a resource with lock token 'opaquelocktoken:8aeb4384-04ee-8042-bd51-d18cc4a34143', a PUT request with the following If header should suceed:  (<opaquelocktoken:8aeb4384-04ee-8042-bd51-d18cc4a34143>) (Not <DAV:no-lock>)  (note that 'DAV:no-lock' is a well-formed URI that provably does not represent any existing lock, so 'Not<DAV:no-lock>' should evaluate TRUE.	Fixed in modules/dav/main/util.c r1.43 of httpd-2.0.  We will now skip all lock tokens that are denoted as invalid format.  This patch has been suggested for inclusion in the next httpd 2.0 release.

16637	null	RESOLVED		Laimutis Ignatavicius	1044018840000	1150958817000		ISAPI: HTTP 200 OK error response is still returned Thank you for fixing the Bug#: 10216 in version 2.0.44. It stopped displaying  HTTP 200 OK error response in very most cases.  But there is one more case when this 'error' response is displayed: when ISAPI  extension does not include any HTTP header in it response.   We traced mod_isapi.c and found such a situation:  1. ISAPI extension calls ServerSupportFunction with '200 OK' in buf_data  parameter, 0 in buf_size parameter, and pointer to a 'null-terminated string  pointing to optional headers or data to be appended and sent with the header'  (excerpt from Microsoft MFC Library Reference) in data_type parameter.  2. ServerSupportFunction calls send_response_header function, and it returns  at line 795:      /* If only Status was passed, we consumed nothing       */     if (!head_present)         return 0;             /* <- line 795 */      cid->headers_set = 1;     /* <- line 797 */  3. Line 797, added in version 2.0.44, is not entered, and bug fix code, added  for correcting the buggy '200 OK' response, is not entered (line 1597). Line  1595 returns the value 200, causing the result to run through the core die  handler:      /* Flush the response now, including headers-only responses */     if (cid->headers_set) { <...>         cid->response_sent = 1;          return OK;  /* NOT r->status or cid->r->status, even if it has  changed. */     }          /* As the client returned no error, and if we did not error out      * ourselves, trust dwHttpStatusCode to say something relevant.      */     if (!ap_is_HTTP_SERVER_ERROR(r->status) && cid->ecb->dwHttpStatusCode) {         r->status = cid->ecb->dwHttpStatusCode;     }      /* For all missing-response situations simply return the status.      * and let the core deal respond to the client.      */     return r->status; /* <- line 1595 */   Recommendations for solving the problem: move code line 797 four lines above.   Another minor problem, considering the same bug-fix code added, is that HTTP  status code 200 is not logged in 'access.log' for all successful calls of an  ISAPI extension, with exception to the problem described above. These  responses are logged normally. :-)  Recommendations for solving problem: insert one line of code in mod_isapi.c,  line 1582:          r->status = cid->ecb->dwHttpStatusCode; /* <- line 1582 */          return OK;  /* NOT r->status or cid->r->status, even if it has  changed. */	   Actually, there was a small logic error related to the way that some   calls were processed in send_response_header.  We believe the new code   is cleaner, but it may or may not resolve your issue altogether.    If you are building Apache yourself, please replace your mod_isapi.c module   with the current CVS available from;  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/httpd-2.0/modules/arch/win32/mod_isapi.c?rev=1.88.2.2    And let us know if the error remains.  I suspect it does.    One thing you mention is that we call from ServerSupportFunction() ... in   fact we have several potential calls from that code - please identify which   call to ServerSupportFunction is't working.    I guess that sending any body, whatsoever should toggle cid->headers_set to   1 so that everything else works.    Let me make certain; are you trying to send a response 200 OK with *no*   headers, *AND* no body?     Closed 30033, presuming fixed in trunk.

16739	null	CLOSED		Laurent Faillie	1044315960000	1045231927000		Problem w/ IPv4 when system can also use IPv6 Hi all,  I'm using Apache 2.0.44 on a old Sun Sparc Station 5 under NetBSD 1.6. I think, there is no problem on this server as another Apache 1.3.26 is running on an other port w/o troubles.   This station has 2 ethernets card :  - 1 connected to my internal network w/ a fixed address (192.168.0.3), - 1 connected to a cable modem binding to a dynamicaly address allocated by my ISP DHCP server.  My problem is I can't access to this web server if I haven't specified the address in the Listen directive.  For example : If I use 'Listen 8085', only telnet localhost 8085 succeed. Connection from other machine fails w/ 'Connection refused' error.  If I use 'Listen 192.168.0.3:8085', I can connect from a machine on my own network but a telnet fails : telnet localhost 8085 Trying ::1... telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused Trying 127.0.0.1... telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused  A simple workaround should be to use some Listen directive, but I will be difficult w/ DHCP address. Any help welcome ;-D  Rgds,  Laurent	According to 'netstat', it seems Apache2 only listening IPv6 networks on my system. I will try to add option '--enable-v4-mapped'.  Anyway, as the documentation said 'Listen w/o network make apache waiting for all network', it should implie both v4 and v6 by default. Using '--enable-v4-mapped', I can now connect to the machine ... but no data is sent :-(  telnet ra 8085 Trying 192.168.0.3... Connected to ra.chez.moi. Escape character is '^]'. GET / Connection closed by foreign host.  Any help welcome ;-D  Bye  Laurent  Well, I found a workaround in the database : as for bug #7492 of the 'old database', I have added a 'Listen 0.0.0.0:8085'. Now it's working :-)  I keep this bug open, because I think a problem remains : ok, using --enable-v4-mapped, IPv4 networks is checked, but w/o this second Listen directive, the server won't return correct page but only close the connection.  Bye  Laurent  Here is what is supposed to happen with recent Apache:  For any version of netbsd with IPv6, apache  1) assumes v4-mapped addresses can't/shouldn't be used (i.e., assumes    --disable-v4-mapped) 2) puts two listen statements in default config file:    Listen 0.0.0.0:port    Listen [::]:port     (note that if you have old config file the one with the 'right' listen    statements will be httpd-std.conf)  Also, when Apache doesn't plan to use v4-mapped addresses, it will enable the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option if it exists.  The documentation needs to talk about --enable-v4-mapped vs. --disable-v4-mapped and what Listen statement(s) is(are) needed in either case.  As far as the weird error scenario (--enable-v4-mapped, 'Listen 8085', whatever is listening on port 8085 drops the connect): Is there truss or strace that you can use on Apache for this case to give an idea of what is happening?   Hum, netstat -a doesn't help (apache listening on both ipv4 and v6 worlds, so  nothing abnormal).  I duno which other tests I can made to have more informations but add some  tracing 'printf()' inside Apache code. But ... where can I start ? I'm not fully  aware of 'deep inside' stuffs in Apache code. Anyway, I will try.  If someone want to make some checks or tests, I can give a temporary access to  this machine. A slow machine but w/ a permanent connection to the web thru  cable.  Bye  Laurent  PS: hum, what do you think about adding NetBSD as target OS in your side ? ;-D I'm changing this to a doc problem.  I was able to verify that on NetBSD 1.6, the --enable-v4-mapped and --disable-v4-mapped configure options work properly and generate the proper Listen directives in the default configuration file. But the documentation was woefully inadequate for this issue, so it could not be expected that users who ignore the default configuration file would automatically arrive at the right set of Listen directives.  Better doc for this has now been added to the manual in this  section:  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/bind.html#ipv6			Jeff Trawick	Laurent Faillie

16908	null	CLOSED		Andrew Gapon	1044736020000	1045634454000		mod_mime_magic incorrectly handles unrecognized files there is a bug in mod_mime_magic, due to which mod_mime_magic sets content type for a file, that it can not actually recognize, to text/plain and returns successful status. This happens because ascmagic() sets type to 'text/plain' and reurns success even if all magic check have failed. In addition to that, even if ascmagic() would behave correctly, module would anyway set content type to application/octet-stream and returned success. Such a behaviour (1) overrides DefaultType parameter and makes it useless in the presense of mod_mime_magic and (2) puts too much intelegence in  mod_mime_magic by making a decision about 'last resort' content type, instead of honestly returning an error.	Created an attachment (id=4791) proposed patch  How-To-Repeat  1. enable mod_mime_magic in apache 2. set DefaultType to anything but text/plain 3. create a file that is not of any known type and does not have any known  extension, (in my case it was export of Windows2000 security console settings - *.msc file) 4. make the file accessible via apache via http 5. get the file from http client 6. observe that apache returns content type as text/plain    This has been fixed in httpd-2.0: modules/metadata/mod_mime_magic.c r1.61.  I'm not entirely sure this will be backported to 1.3 or 2.0.  It could be, but this is esoteric enough that I think it can wait until 2.2.			Andrew Gapon	Justin Erenkrantz

So, in setting up the make configuration using the 'configure' script, the user would probably enter:        'suexec-umask=22'  believing that this would cause the group and world write bits to be turned off in any file created by a program running under suexec.  However, because of the format used in the suexec.c line above, the value of  'SUEXEC_UMASK' is treated as a decimal value and converted to octal for internal use by suexec.  The above value of 22 (assumed by the user to already be in octal) would become 26 inside suexec, which is definitely not what the user expected!  The proper line would be, I think:          fprintf(stderr, ' -D SUEXEC_UMASK=%03d/n', SUEXEC_UMASK);  Either that, or the suexec documentation should be modified to make it clear that suexec-umask requires a decimal  value.  I would prefer the first solution.	It's silently assumed, that people use 'suexec-umask=022'. However, changed configure to always prepend a '0' as 2.x configure does, too.

We test by running a php script via the cgi interface and  using lsof to list the open file handles. (See below)  This enables cgi's to access the logs of other virtual hosts.

error logs  Apache httpd fails to close access and error logs when it forks and  execs cgi scripts.  From our preliminary understanding of the code the fix is to call apr_file_inherit_unset() in place of  apr_file_inherit_set() in both server/log.c and loggers/mod_log_config.c.  The bug first appeared going from 2.0.39 to 2.0.40 because a typo in the definition of the APR_INHERIT flag had reversed the effect of apr_file_inherit_set().  For this please see cvs diff of /apr/include/arch/unix/Attic/inherit.h between 1.10 and 1.11.  The attached patch forces cleanup of logfiles on fork/exec of cgi's.  All calls of *_inherit_set() and *_inherit_unset() should be validated  for correct behavior in their respective contexts.  Credit for digging through the sources and finding the fix goes Bjoern Zeeb <bzeeb@zabbadoz.net>.  In case of questions we have more detailed information available. Please email.     the fix does not help with all mpms.

17217	null	CLOSED		Aaron Axelsen	1045684080000	1078942071000		mod_ssl cannot be used as a DSO with static OpenSSL libraries Since upgrading to apache 2.0.44 I cannot get ssl to work.  I get the following  errors when I try to start apache loading the mod_ssl module:  Syntax error on line 263 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf: Cannot load /usr/local/apache/modules/mod_ssl.so into server: /usr/local/apache/ modules/mod_ssl.so: undefined symbol: SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa_callback  This is loading the exact same ssl.conf file that i used for apache 2.0.43.  Is  there some kind of a bug with 2.0.44 and ssl?	The only code that references SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa_callback was added before 2.0.43.  Perhaps you have a version of openssl in your library path now that doesn't implement that function?  Maybe openssl isn't found at all and that is simply the first function that couldn't be resolved?  Just maybe you didn't specify --enable-ssl on your configure invocation for 2.0.44 and so httpd executable didn't reference the openssl library?  In this case, the mod_ssl.so you're trying to use could be from a previous build of 2.0.43.  ?????  the only way i could get it to work was to recomiple it with --enable- ssl=static.  It fails to load as a loadable module. That would be consistent with your openssl library being built as a static library instead of as a dynamic library.  Even if it was static and noy dynamic, how come it worked with only --enable- ssl in 2.0.43 and i had to do --enable-ssl=static in 2.0.44? You need to post exactly how you build apache and openssl, this could mean any  number of things. And how you start Apache. To state the issue concisely:  If building mod_ssl as a DSO against static OpenSSL libraries, mod_ssl will not load.  This is because the only place that symbols from the SSL libraries are referenced is mod_ssl, but only httpd itself is linked against -lssl -lcrypto.  The workaround is to use shared OpenSSL libraries or a statically-linked mod_ssl. *** Bug 22057 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Fixed on HEAD, probably worthy of backport.

The use of comments within AuthUserfile/AuthGroupfile isn't really recommended,  so I tend to say 'wontfix' here.  Thanks for the hint.  How about putting a link to http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/configuring.html#syntax in the htaccess file ? (after all we are no longer in the paper world of sequential reading, but hypertext and search engines are typically used today, so a user may just see the htaccess file, but not all the rest of the documentation.)  As for the other two, what do you mean with 'not really recommended'?  I would guess it is good practice to put such files under version control and thus  a comment with at least the version control tag would be recommended too? Does it work or will it break something? I.e. s the Group file a configuration file as per  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/configuring.html where  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/configuring.html#syntax applies or not? An appropriate link has been added.  Thanks for the suggestion.			Andr?? Malo	Joshua Slive	Ralf Hauser
17274	null	RESOLVED		Laurent Blume	1045822440000	1118665133000		 after an erroneous login attempt (this is the copy of an email I posted on the mod_ldap list and the Apache users list - two emails actually, I replied to myself - I hope nobody will mind, I already spent time diagnosing the bug, I just had no time to follow a bug report till now :-)  I can confirm that this problem is a bug related to how mod_ldap handles the behaviour of the AD server. When a bind has succeeded, the module keeps the session open for any following request. However, when the first bind (with AuthLDAPBindDN) was successful, and then the second (with login/wrong password) failed, the module considers the session is still bound, while the AD server thinks it has no permission anymore. So, on the next search, the AD server replies with a 'Success' with no entry, that the module interprets as a 'User not unique'.  Since I don't mind the module establishing a new session everytime, I made sure that it's killed after every search.  If I have the time, I'll try to make a more consistent patch  IS this the right mailing list to post it or should it go to an Apache one now that this module has been included ?  My quick fix: $ diff mod_auth_ldap.c~  mod_auth_ldap.c 279c279 <     util_ldap_connection_close(ldc); --- >     util_ldap_connection_destroy(ldc);   Laurent Blume wrote:  > I snooped the packets, and I did notice something weird: > > When there is a successful authentication (login and password are ok on the first try), the conversation between the Apache server and the LDAP server goes like this: >  - new TCP session established; >  - bind request with the AuthLDAPBindDN and AuthLDAPBindPassword; >  - bind result: success; >  - search request with the Base DN, attribute name, and the login entered as the attribute value; >  - search result: success, containing only one value; >  - bind request with the DN in the value just received; >  - bind result: success; >  - TCP session ends; > > All those steps are repeated every time. > > When the login password is wrong for the first try, it goes like this: >  - new TCP session established; >  - bind request with the AuthLDAPBindDN and AuthLDAPBindPassword; >  - bind result: success; >  - search request with the Base DN, attribute name, and the login entered as the attribute value; >  - search result: success, containing only one value; >  - bind request with the DN in the value just received; >  - bind result: Invalid credentials; > > The main difference being, _the TCP session is not closed_. > When there is another try with the same login, whatever the password is, there is no new TCP session, it continues in the same, right after the bind result, like this: >  - search request with the Base DN, attribute name, and the login entered as the attribute value; >  - search result: success, containing no value; > > Nothing else, the TCP session is still *not* closed, it continues with the same values for every try. > >  From what I understand, since the last Bind request failed, the AD server considers the client has no authorization. Its behaviour in that case is to reply with a Success, but with no value returned. 0 being different from 1, the module interprets this as 'User is not unique'. > I haven't used any other LDAP server so far, but I've seen that AD is different in that it requires authentication before allowing a search. > Actually, a server allowing an anonymous search would probably work in my case, so I guess it's AD particular behaviour that is not correctly handled. > > I've started to look at the sources to get a better understanding on what goes on, but my C days are a bit far in my past, I'm not sure I'll be able to fix that.	i have exactly the same problem with openldap 2.0.25, apache 2.0.44 and freebsd 4.7. the quick fix solved the problem for me. i agree that the problem seems to be that the module assumes that the session can be used for authentication attempts again, which is not be permitted by the ldap servers access control. I have the same problem, I'm using: httpd-2.0.44 against ms active directory (ms w2k)  I'm going through the bug db to make sure patches are findable.  Please see  http://httpd.apache.org/dev/patches.html  I have this problem in my production mandrake 9.2 server, and would love to just get a fixed binary - is this being fixed in the actual binaries, or will this just continue to be a sourcecode patch? Seeing this on Windows 200 SP4 Active Directory, using Apache HTTP Server 2.0.49 on Windows.    When incorrect password is input, error log logs:  [*date*] [warn] [client *ipaddress*] [832] auth_ldap authenticate: user *username* authentication failed; URI *uri* [ldap_simple_bind_s() to check user credentials failed][Invalid Credentials]  Subsequent attempt to login with correct password cause this error in the logs:  [*date] [warn] [client *ipaddress*] [832] auth_ldap authenticate: user *username* authentication failed; URI *uri* [User not found][No Such Object] Please try the patch at http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27748 and tell me if it fixes this problem. This patch has been applied to v2.1.0-dev, and awaits backporting to v2.0.50-dev.  I applied the patch to 2.0.49, built it with similar options. It now authenticates correctly against the AD server, even when entering invalid login/password combinations first.  So it seems to fix the problem for me. Sweet, thanks :) Does 2.0.53 fix this problem??  I was using 2.0.47 and it has the same problem...  I couldnt change the source,  from: <     util_ldap_connection_close(ldc);  to >     util_ldap_connection_destroy(ldc);    It would give compile errors     thanks  Joshua This was fixed in v2.0.51 - can you confirm whether this is still broken, and reopen if so?

Just place it in the main directory, but  it'll work in a subdirectory, in which case change the last line to  RewriteRule ^(.*) /subdir/index.html  The file index.html SHOULD NOT exist. Then call  http://yoursite.com/  or  http://yoursite.com/subdir/  and the browser window won't stop loading. On the server side, you'll get a  pretty nasty httpd process using up a whole lot of CPU and memory. And if the  URL is called a bunch of times, the server can lock up!  I did not experience the bug on Apache 2.0.40 (Red Hat 8.0 RPM install), only  on 1.3.27, both compiled by hand and RH 7.3 RPM install.  -Dario Gomes	he, you'll need a better system that finishs this endless loop under one minute ;-)  It's a known issue. You're simply creating an endless loop of internal redirects. Thatswhy you already should test your rules before putting them on a production server.  However, I'm changing this to an Enhancement request. We should be able to set a configurable limit of maximum redirects issued by mod_rewrite.  Thanks for using Apache! The problem is I run a shared hosting server, and I have no control of the  rules my users put on their sites... I got the server locked up two times  before I found the source of the problem!  Why doesn't this bug affect Apache 2.0.4x? Maybe they've worked out this issue  already?  -Dario In 2.0 the trick doesn't work with your ruleset, because of a different behaviour of mod_dir. You can crash the server, for example, with the following in a htaccess file (in docroot):  RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule (.*) / [L]  However, a configurable limit was introduced in 2.1 and is proposed for backport. FYI: The enhancement will appear in the next releases (1.3.28 and 2.0.45).			Andr?? Malo	Dario Gomes

The atof function is dependent on some locale settings? In some locales (include russian), comma is used as decimal point separator. Thus atof function under such locales is false to parse right variant weight with dot as desimal point separator. Well, I've fixed the problem by dropping atof() entirely (and writing our own more RFC compliant version). The fix currently applies to version 2.1 (main dev branch) and is proposed for backport.

I have tried to copy the whole contents of C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2 to c:/MyWeb/Web but Apache still will not start.  This used to work (2.0.39 I seemm to remember).	'will not start' isn't a helpful description for the error. What happens exactly and what error messages will occur?  Thanks. 'Will not start' is not supposed to be helpful: it is an accurate description!  HEre are the steps:  1) start the apache service monitor.  2) Edit the apache httpd.conf file  3) Modify the ServerRoot as described  4) click the 'Restart' button on the Apache Service Monitor  5) a popup window is displayed, saying: Error The requested operation has failed!  The Apache error log has nothing related to this error  Therefore my original description was accurate and complete  QED Maybe accurate, but not helpful anyway ;-)  However, please do the following: - open your console and cd to the apache2-bin directory - type apache -k start  An error message should be written to the console. This message usually appears to be helpful :)  (Btw: Are you sure, you want to modify ServerRoot and not DocumentRoot?)  Thanks. ehm, instead of apache -k start, I meant to say apache -k restart. Thanks for your help.

I would assume that when Apache starts, it remembers where it starts from: the  eveidence for this is that Apache knows where to find the httpd.conf file  (located in ../conf). Therefore there should be no problem in accessing the modules in ../modules,  regardless of the setting for ServerRoot.  I believe that this used to be the behaviour before (2.0.39 I seem to remember).

The documentation for Apache says that ServerRoot is _typically_ used to determine the base directory for log files and configuration files. (we should mention modules/ there also, right.)  Actually it is used to resolve any relative path (that's what it's supposed to). So if you want to keep your module files in the old path, you have to use absolute paths and everything is fine.  If it didn't work that way in older versions it must be a bug there ;-).  Why can't httpd take the location where it starts from? The answer is simple. On most systems (especially *x) there is no reliable way to determine this location.  I'm changing this report to be a docs enhancement.  Thanks for using Apache!

18156	null	CLOSED		Ian Gulliver	1048100580000	1092817537000		Suexec runs as the VirtualHost user instead of the owner of the UserDir When executing CGI's inside a Userdir, Apache attempts to run the CGI at the SuexecUserGroup from the VirtualHost directive instead of the user who's directory we're looking at.  This trips the security protection in suexec and causes an Internal Server Error message.  Suexec logs something like:  [2003-03-19 18:57:32]: target uid/gid (1000/1000) mismatch with directory (1053/1053) or program (1053/1053)  (Where 1000/1000 is the SuexecUserGroup for the 'ares.penguinhosting.net' named virtual host, and 1053/1053 is the user/group of 'david' for the listed URL).  Apache 1 behaves properly in the same case.	I'm having the exact same problem. Running suexec in the document root is no problem, however, Apache is not sending the '~' to Suexec when a userdir is accessed. Are you actually using mod_userdir ONLY to serve these requests, or is there some kind of Alias/ScriptAlias/RewriteRule that is involved? I've got some Rewriterules, but they don't apply for the UserDir directive.

I'm facing EXACTLY the same problem on 2.0.49,  which renders it completely unusable for me. Apache 1 worked fine, it used User  and Group when no UserDir request was made, and used the correct user when a  UserDir request was made.

This one is a really bad one :-( Perhaps someone could answer to the question regarding the scriptalias directives? Or better - attach the *full* config? I have attached my config. Is there some important part missing? It doesn't work with and without RewriteRules. 'm guessing this is a variation of the 'bug' (really documentation problem) with suexec + UserDir in Apache 2.0.x.  Basically, you cannot use the 'old style' scriptalias directives with user dirs and suexec.  Try this version of your user CGI bin directory setup:          <Directory ~ '/home/sites/site1/users/*/web'>             Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Includes +ExecCGI             AllowOverride All             Order allow,deny             Allow from all             SetHandler cgi-script         </Directory>  Oh, you need to include the UserDir and SuExec modulea:  LoadModule userdir_module modules/mod_userdir.so LoadModule suexec_module modules/mod_suexec.so  And *don't* include any sort of scriptalias for your user's dirs.  LoadModule suexec_module modules/mod_suexec.so and LoadModule userdir_module modules/mod_userdir.so are activated in my httpd.conf.  However, your solution shown below does not help. :-( May I e-mail you my httpd.conf and my included virtualhosts.conf, so you can check it? Because of data privacy and security issues, I don't want to attach the full  configuration to this bug.  May I e-mail it to you privately?  Thanks! I'm not one of the Apache developers, just a fellow user of suexec.  I am not sure how much help I can give you.  I don't presently have an  Apache 2.0.x server installed and running anywhere at present, so I  cannot actually test anything either.  All I know is that    It is entirely possible that it is a real bug.  Maybe what you need to post is a stripped down version of your  httpd.conf and virtualhosts.conf files, ones that are minimually  suffientent to cause the problem, but which don't leak any real  (priviledged) data -- this way the developers can re-create your problem      and then come up with a working solution.  Hi there, and thanks for the quick reply ;-) If any of the developers could post to this bug (I haven't heard anything from them yet ;-( I'd happily provide them with my httpd.conf ;) Here's what you should do: Start with a default install of apache from httpd.apache.org, and then make the absolute minimum changes that are necessary to show the problem.

Thanks for taking the time. ;-) Created an attachment (id=11376) patch for the original httpd.conf file  Thanks, that's clearer.  But there is still some stuff which I assume is irrelevant to your problem, like the mod_rewrite directives and the UserDir disabled stuff.  Does your problem go away if you remove those?  Unfortunately, I don't have a unix system available to test on at the moment.  I've looked at the code, and it appears to me that when both SuexecUserGroup and mod_userdir is active, there is no defined ordering between the get_suexec_identity hooks.  So perhaps the userdir suexec stuff doesn't work at all if SuexecUserGroup is present.  In that case, simply fixing the hook ordering could fix the problem. Thanks for your fast reply! I've set the following lines (in the patch) to the httpd.conf defaults:  === -UserDir public_html +#UserDir public_html +UserDir disabled +UserDir disabled root [...] +RewriteEngine on +RewriteOptions inherit [...] +Userdir enabled user2 ===  I still get an Internal Server Error, so they don't seem to have anything to do with the problem. ;-)  Is there anything else you need or did I sent all information necessary to fix the bug?

Thanks Joshua, this one seems to work! I've tested it locally, and I have no problems anymore! ;-)  Will this bugfix be incorporated in 2.0.50? I won't commit this myself, since I can't test it.  But another developer will hopefully pick it up.  This could be considered a non-compatible change, since there is a chance someone might be relying on SuexecUserGroup taking precedence of UserDir for suexec.  But this change should get us closer to the way it worked in 1.3, and it makes sense to me as the expected way things should work, so I think it should be committed. Okay :) Maybe you just have to make the change clear in the change log or add an option  for httpd.conf to choose between the 'new old' and the 2.0 default behaviour. Thanks again for your quick reply and great help, much appreciated! Where can I 'find' a developer to test and eventually contribute this to the CVS? :-) A workaround is to swap the order of the LoadModule lines for suexec and userdir.  I'll test Joshua's patch: it's hard to argue this is an incompatible change since the current behaviour is not defined so it's OK for 2.0 as well, I'd guess. Committed, will propose for backport.  Thanks for the report and thank you Joshua for the patch. Thanks a lot for implementing it! :-)			Andr?? Malo	Florian Effenberger	Hans	Joe Orton	Joshua Slive	Robert Heller

The custom error response documentation <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/custom-error.html> says that a CGI error document handler 'should' include a Status header, but if the script uses a Location: header it MUST also include a Status: 30x if the redirection is to have any effect. For example, if you want to hand off 404 errors to a different server this piece of (perl) script will work, but without the Status line, nothing appears to happen, and no errors are logged - the server sends the original 404 code to the client which then ignores the Location:.   $handoff = 'http://my.other.server/cgi-bin/from-old-server'; print 'Status: 301 Redirect permanent/n'; print 'Location: $handoff?url=$ENV{REDIRECT_URL}/n'; print '/n';	I've added a paragraph according to this issue.

Found what appears to be the correct text in Tru64 Unix docs  Apache 'rotatelogs' man page:      logfile        The path plus basename of the logfile.  If logfile includes any %        characters, it is treated as a format string for strftime(3).        Otherwise, the suffix .nnnn is automatically added and is the time at        which the logfile was created.  Also, 'Severity' drop down on this bug submit page is missing 'Trivial'.

The argument you give gets  incorrectly looked up in the ./srclib/apr/config.layout file rather than just  the ./config.layout file, and configure fails.  Same problem would likely occur  with ./srclib/apr-util/config.layout as well, if it were able to get that far.	A fix for this has been committed to 2.1-dev and will be suggested for merging into 2.0.46-dev.  Here is the fix:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/configure.in.diff?r1=1.246&r2=1.247  Thanks for your report, and I'm sorry that this was broken in 2.0.45.  The regression was discovered at the last minute, and due to the high severity of some of the issues resolved by 2.0.45 it was felt that it was best to get 2.0.45 out the door. this has now been merged into 2.0.46-dev.

Any chance you have apache header files in /usr/local/include from some previous install?  /usr/local/include is getting searched before /tmp/httpd- 2.0.45/include. My system did have older files located under /usr/local/include.  I removed  those files and the compilation worked flawlessly.  I've been using Apache for  six or seven years and never knew that it looked outside it's temp directory  when compiling.  I don't know if I feel more relieved or stupid...    Thank you VERY, VERY much.  Sorry to have wasted your time with my erroneous  bug report.  Andrew  This is something that at least a few people have hit.  Apache or apr-util or apr may need to look for include files in /usr/local/include, or other places where old Apache header files could have been installed, when using external libraries (zlib, berkeley db, openssl, whatever).  It would be nice if the search order for Apache was  apache-source-directories apr-include-directories apr-util-include-directories  (order not important for these first three)  followed by any directories needed for libraries used by apache or apr or apr-util.  That would get rid of this problem.  *** Bug 23485 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 30208 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Fixed in HEAD by ensuring that the 'apache-source-directories' come first in INCLUDES, which should be sufficient to fix most of these cases. *** Bug 42357 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Andrew Fried	Jean-Francois Gobin	Jeff Trawick	Joe Orton

Also, drop the --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE argument.  That too is Apache-1.3-style configure argument which means nothing to Apache 2.0.  (But I suspect you have mod_so anyway...  mod_so defaults to on for most systems (including AIX 5.1)...  Try ./httpd -l and see if mod_so.c is in the output.)  Also, there is a bug in the message generation.  As you noticed, nothing is printed in the expected position to say yes or no or shared.  Thank you for the information.  I recomplired Aapche,  I check httpd -l to make  sure I had mod_so,  but after I used JRun 4 connector to configure with Apache. here is the error I am getting. # ./apachectl start Syntax error on line 1037 of /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf: Cannot load /home/tfan/jrun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so into server:   here is line 1037 from httpd.conf: LoadModule jrun_module /home/tfan/jrun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so  this error most likely is mod_so doesn't work.  any ideal? Ehm no, the error probably says, that mod_jrun doesn't work with that httpd version.    Syntax error on line 1037 of /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf:   Cannot load /home/tfan/jrun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so into server:    <here is the interesting part>  what is the interesting message? Unfortunately, some Apache modules don't build properly on AIX and an inability to load them is a frequent symptom.  See my fun at trying to get some Tomcat connectors to build properly  on AIX: http://www.apache.org/~trawick/tomcataix.html  Send me privately the output of 'dump -Tv mod_jrun20.so' and 'dump -Hv mod_jrun20.so' and I'll maybe have a guess as to why they won't load.

noted back at square one...  your DSO looks great  try this:  $ cd /path/to/httpd-2.0.45 $ grep HTTPD_LDFLAGS build/config_vars.mk  I bet the output is simply  HTTPD_LDFLAGS =   when it should be something similar to   HTTPD_LDFLAGS = -Wl,-uXML_Parse -Wl,-bE:/path/to/server/httpd.exp  The lack of the weird '-Wl,-bE:' option means that httpd doesn't export the Apache API to DSOs, subsequently leading to DSOs failing to load.  Depending on how mod_so gets enabled, the variable $enable_so may or may not get set, and if it isn't set then the right LDFLAGS for linking httpd don't get initialized.  If you verify that HTTPD_LDFLAGS is an empty string, here is a work-around that worked for me:  Add '--enable-so' to your Apache configure invocation, as in  make distclean && ./configure --enable-so --other-opts && make && make install  By explicitly turning on mod_so (using the Apache 2 option this time :) ), we avoid the bug. This has been fixed in 2.1-dev, and if nobody complains about the fix in the next few days I'll propose it for merging into 2.0.46-dev.  Until then, specify --enable-so.  I recompiled as your suggection.  after that I check: 1. config.log (I can see mod_so turned on YES) 2. HTTPD_LDFLAGS = -Wl,-uXML_Parse -Wl,-bE:/path/to/server/httpd.exp 3. httpd -l showed mod_so  but when I start up Aapche still got same error. # ./apachectl start Syntax error on line 1037 of /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf: Cannot load /home/tfan/jrun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so into server:   plz send me off-line (trawick@apache.org) the output of   dump -Tv /path/to/new/httpd  (the one picked up by your still-failing ./apachectl start)  ISTR hearing off-line that the Apache build was corrected with the --enable-so work-around, and that further work was going to be done with the 3rd-party module build to see why it wasn't loading.

19242	null	CLOSED		Mike	1051064820000	1068212996000		Problem Reverse Proxying HTTPS site We are currently having an issue where we are reverse proxying an HTTPS site  using Apache.  Every second request to the site (via the rev proxy) fails with  a 500 Internal Server Error.  I have done various debugging such as snoops,  trusses and debug apache logging.  What seems to happen is the first (successful) request works as expected,  however when the second request is sent, the SSL session between the client and  proxy is set up okay, but the SSL connection between the proxy and backend  server has problems.  Basically it (the proxy) sets up the TCP session okay,  sends an SSL Client Hello, but then almost straight away sends a FIN.  I then looked at the apache error log, with full debugging enabled to see why  the proxy would send a client hello, and then straight away send a FIN.  It  seems that there is an issue with an SSL BIO being logged.  It says that 0/7  bytes are being read from the BIO whenever the connection is failing.  However,  when there is a successful connection it reads 7/7 bytes at this same part of  the conversation.  I have also done a truss of a successful vs unsuccessful connection.  When  successful, the httpd process is doing a read, getting an 'Err#11 Eagain'  error, doing a poll, redoing the read, but this time without error.  However on  an unsuccessful connection, the httpd process does the same initial read, gets  the same 'Err#11 Eagain' error, but does not do the poll or reread.   I have verified this exact same behaviour on the following: Solaris 2.6 with Apache 2.0.44 OpenSSL 0.9.7 Solaris 8 with Apache 2.0.44 OpenSSL 0.9.7 (32bit) Solaris 8 with Apache 2.0.45 OpenSSL 0.9.7a (32bit) Solaris 8 with Apache 2.0.45 OpenSSL 0.9.7a (64bit)  I have also tried on both a SunBlade 100 and E450 platform, each with identical  results.  I have tried both prefork and worker mpms with identical results.  I have found that the only workaround (which is very ugly) is to set the  MaxRequestsPerChild to 1.    I have also played with virtually every setting I can think of, particularly  the SSLMutex and AcceptMutex settings.  Nothing other that the above workaround  seems to affect this problem.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated?	Sorry - forgot the build info..

I traced it back to the  'block' member of the 'bio_filter_in_ctx_t' structure not being initialized before being used. So I added initializatoins for the 'block' member and the 'mode' member (also not initialized but didn't contribute to our problem) to the 'ssl_io_input_add_filter' function.  Of interest, the unitialized values ended up being bad after a SSL connection to a MicroSoft ISA server. The ISA server doesn't send a 'close_notify' at the end of the session.     David, the issue with your patch is that we properly initialize within   the input filter, but never properly initialized the blocking mode in   the output filter.  The output filter must always block for a complete   handshake or other activity, so you will find the appropriate patches   with modules/ssl/ssl_engine_io.c rev 1.106, credited to both your initial   efforts and my patch.

Could it be stated for windows (or all OSs) in the  documentation that the /tmp folder needs to be created on the drive that apache  is installed on.  This is an issue because by default windows does not have a  tmp folder in the root of the drive.  Another solution would be to make a  config option for the location.  If someone would like I could take a stab at  coding that option.	Another option would be to put this under the logs sub-directory like many  other Apache MM-like usages do. This appears to be a duplicate of 20242. *** Bug 20242 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** No, we're trying to deprecate the usage of the logs dir for anything but logging. It should use the localstatedir, it being, after all, local state. Where is localstatedir and is it in fact guaranteed to exist (like the logs dir  is)?  [For now I've patched my Apache 2.0.46 to put this in logs, until a better home  which is guaranteed to exist 'out-of-the-box' (without additional  configuration) can be found for it.] Additionally:  Whatever localstatedir is supposed to be, using a hard-coded absolute path is a  non-starter.  Why?  Though it is certainly not recommended, there are times  where one must run 2 Apache's on one system (and even on one drive on Windows).  Thus the path use should be configurable or relative to the Apache installation  directory.  The latter is easy and relatively foolproof.  If 'logs' is  verboten, then how about introducing a standard 'tmp' directory in the Apache  layout (complete with proper permission assignment in the binary installer,  etc) and using it?  Until that's done, I'll stick with using logs...

Mozilla makes repeated requests and finally pops up a dialog saying: 'Redirection limit for this URL exceeded. Unable to load the requested page.'  I suspect the problem is caused by mod_proxy encoding the tilde characters in the URL. Watching the HTTP traffic with and without the proxy reveals that Mozilla sends the tilde unencoded and Apache encodes it with the corresponding percent sequence, which the remote website seems to find confusing. The website keeps sending redirections to the browser until the browser gives up.  I believe Apache proxy should send the URL in exactly the same format it received it. This might violate the RFC, but it would minimize interoperability problems like this.	Patch committed to HEAD; c.f. bug 15207			Nick Kew
19355	null	CLOSED		Geoffrey Young	1051404540000	1067811288000		mod_include allows invalid ETag headers this bug was first reported to dev@httpd.apache.org  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=105120818606501&w=2  mod_include has an ETag bug when activated using XBitHack Full.  in general, default_handler generates an ETag header for documents it serves.  because embedded SSI tags have the ability to alter the content of a document, mod_include strips outgoing ETag headers from responses it enters.  however, the method by which mod_include strips these headers is insufficient in cases where default_handler decides a 304 is warranted.  consider the following series of requests when XBitHack is activated for a document in DocumentRoot (uninteresting headers snipped for brevity)  GET /ssi.html HTTP/1.1  HTTP/1.1 200 OK Last-Modified: Thu, 24 Apr 2003 16:50:50 GMT  -------------  GET /ssi.html HTTP/1.1 If-Modified-Since: Thu, 24 Apr 2003 16:50:50 GMT  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified Last-Modified: Thu, 24 Apr 2003 16:50:50 GMT ETag: '35157-5f-4861ce80'   while mod_include removes the ETag header from the first request, default_handler generates an (almost always invalid) ETag on the subsequent 304.  the below patch seems to be a better way for mod_include to handle ETag generation (or, rather, supression).

I get the following rewrite log when simply fetching /index.xhtml with wget:  ::1 - - [08/Apr/2003:23:00:46 +0200] [wren.elho.net/sid#811a9d8][rid#846cdd8/initial] (4) RewriteCond: input='/index.xhtml' pattern='/.xhtml$' => matched ::1 - - [08/Apr/2003:23:00:46 +0200] [wren.elho.net/sid#811a9d8][rid#846cdd8/initial] (4) RewriteCond: input='*/*' pattern='!application/xhtml/+xml' => matched :1 - - [08/Apr/2003:23:00:46 +0200] [wren.elho.net/sid#811a9d8][rid#846cdd8/initial] (2) remember /index.xhtml to have MIME-type 'text/html' ::1 - - [08/Apr/2003:23:00:46 +0200] [wren.elho.net/sid#811a9d8][rid#846cdd8/initial] (1) pass  through /index.xhtml  This shows that the conditions work and the RewriteRule gets applied,                               but Apache either seems to 'forget' to actually set the MIME-type to                                text/html or something (some filter?) happening after mod_rewrite set                               it, sets it back again.

It *may* work if you permute the LoadModule directives of mod_rewrite and mod_mime. Final fix is in progress.  Thanks for the report and thanks for using Apache.

19688	null	CLOSED		Marc M. Adkins	1052187180000	1095004368000		ap_fputs, ap_fputc, ap_fwrite pass wrong filter pointer to ap_filter_flush? Documentation for ap_fputc, etc. states that the filter argument is 'the filter  doing the writing'.  However, this filter argument is sent as the context for  ap_filter_flush via lower-level apr_ routines.  If an overflow occurs and  ap_filter_flush is called then the filter pointer is used as the target for  ap_pass_brigade by ap_filter_flush.  The result is that the brigade is passed  back to the originating filter, resulting in an infinite loop or other  nastiness.  EITHER the documentation in the source files needs to be changed to state that  the filter argument is 'the NEXT filter to which data should be passed in the  event of an overflow' OR each of the macros ap_fputc, ap_fputs, and ap_fwrite  needs to pass f->next instead of f as the context for any callbacks to  ap_filter_flush.  This can be re-created by building an output filter that generates over 8K of  data via the named macros.  Pass in the output filter's pointer (passed to the  filter handler) and see the bad thing.  Pass in the next filter and see it work  OK.  If this is a documentation glitch (including my misunderstanding it as written)  then it is minor.  If the doc (and my understanding thereof) is correct and the  macros need changing then it is major, as it prevents output filters which send  out more than 8K at a whack from functioning properly.	Somewhat belatedly I realized I should look for examples within the Apache code  body.  I found a call to ap_fwrite in server/protocol.c which passes f->next.   So the answer here is probably 'fix the documentation' (if not 'Marc you're an  idiot' ;).  I went back to Ryan Bloom's 09/2001 article on writing output filters  (http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2001/09/13/apache_2.html) and it states  very clearly that the filter argument to all of these routines is filter- >next.  I had read this article, but apparently not with enough attention to  detail.  Then I went to the documentation line I quoted above in the source and  confused myself.  Sorry for registering a bug on this.  I still believe the doc should be fixed  and it is in fact taken from the code (as it should be).  I'm willing to do it  myself and submit diffs if requested.  Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa. Diffs would be cool.  Attach em and I will look at committing them :) Definitely a documentation bug.  To change the code will break more-or-less every existing filter.  I'll do something with it if noone else gets there first. Committing documentation fix in CVS			Marc M. Adkins	Nick Kew	Paul Querna

19849	null	CLOSED		Glenn Nielsen	1052746380000	1056399652000		If the mod_cgid daemon process dies it is never restarted System, Sun Netra T1, Solaris 7, Apache 2.0.45 with worker MPM.  When stress testing a binary cgi the mod_cgid daemon would die. After it had died Apache would detect and log that it had died with this message in the error_log, 'No such process: cgid daemon is gone; is Apache terminating?'.  It does not attempt to restart the cgi daemon process again so all subsequent CGI requests fail.  Apache 2 with the worker MPM for CGI would be more robust if mod_cgid could restart its child daemon process if it dies.	I have done some more research.  When the cgid_daemon dies I see the following error message, the pid is for the cgid_daemon:  [Wed May 28 11:05:59 2003] [notice] child pid 24470 exit signal Broken pipe (13)  I added some debug logging to the cgid_maint function in mod_cgid.c.

At first I tried doing a server restart like the cgid_maint code had originally been setup to do, ( kill(getpid(), AP_SIG_GRACEFUL); ) but after  an apache restart from cgid_maint I saw a number of the following warning messages. cgid worked fine though.  [Wed May 28 10:49:42 2003] [warn] long lost child came home! (pid 21018) [Wed May 28 10:49:42 2003] [warn] long lost child came home! (pid 21019)  So I wrote a patch that would just restart the cgid daemon rather than restart apache itself.  This patch seems to work fine. Created an attachment (id=6553) patch to restart cgid daemon if it dies  A final note.  We started upgrading some of our production Sun Solaris servers to Apache 2 seven weeks ago  Two of those servers have had the cgid daemon die at once during the seven week period.  This resulted in cgi's failing until our customers notified us of the problem.  We then had to restart or stop/start apache.  The patch I sumbitted will automatically restart the cgid daemon so that only a few cgi requests fail rather coninuous failure until restart or stop/start of apache. Thanks for your patch, and hopefully it will get reviewed/committed soon.  I wanted to mention that if you're running into any problems with cgid, you need to apply this patch:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/generators/mod_cgid.c.diff?r1=1.150&r2=1.151  That fixes a simple bug with horrendous consequences, including the murder of the cgid daemon process (with the sigpipe in the library).  patch committed, thanks!!!!!  I'll propose it for merging into the stable branch (2.0.47-dev).  *** Bug 22483 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 23533 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Glenn Nielsen	Jeff Trawick

The guts of the patch are basically appending a flush bucket after every read(unless there is already an EOS) if the ProxyWriteThrough directive is set to On   --------------------------------------------------------- Chris Conti cmconti@mindspring.com chris.conti@xcellenet.com  diff -u /ApacheSrc/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c /ApacheSrc-orig/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c --- /ApacheSrc/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c  2003-05-02 16:22:53.000000000 -0400 +++ /ApacheSrc-orig/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c     2003-02-03 10:31:50.000000000 -0500 @@ -956,18 +956,6 @@                          /* signal that we must leave */                          finish = TRUE;                      } - -                    /* do we need to always send the data? */ -                    if (conf->write_through  && !finish){ -                        apr_off_t readbytes; -                        apr_brigade_length(bb, 0, &readbytes); - - -                        if(0 != readbytes){ -                            apr_bucket *e = apr_bucket_flush_create(c->bucket_alloc); -                            APR_BRIGADE_INSERT_TAIL(bb, e); -                        } -                    }                       /* try send what we read */                      if (ap_pass_brigade(r->output_filters, bb) != APR_SUCCESS) {   diff -u /ApacheSrc/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.h /ApacheSrc-orig/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.h --- /ApacheSrc/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.h   2003-04-29 09:20:12.000000000 -0400 +++ /ApacheSrc-orig/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.h      2003-02-03 10:31:50.000000000 -0500 @@ -201,8 +201,6 @@        bad_body      } badopt;                   /* how to deal with bad headers */      char badopt_set; -    int  write_through; -    char write_through_set;   } proxy_server_conf;    diff -u /ApacheSrc/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c /ApacheSrc-orig/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c --- /ApacheSrc/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c   2003-04-29 09:20:12.000000000 -0400 +++ /ApacheSrc-orig/httpd-2.0.45/modules/proxy/mod_proxy.c      2003-02-22 11:38:14.000000000 -0500 @@ -503,8 +503,6 @@      ps->timeout_set = 0;      ps->badopt = bad_error;      ps->badopt_set = 0; -    ps->write_through = 0; -    ps->write_through_set = 0;      return ps;  }  @@ -532,7 +530,6 @@      ps->preserve_host = (overrides->preserve_host_set == 0) ? base->preserve_host : overrides->preserve_host;      ps->timeout= (overrides->timeout_set == 0) ? base->timeout : overrides->timeout;      ps->badopt = (overrides->badopt_set == 0) ? base->badopt : overrides->badopt; -    ps->write_through = (overrides->write_through_set == 0) ? base->write_through : overrides->write_through;       return ps;  } @@ -816,16 +813,6 @@      psf->req_set = 1;      return NULL;  } -static const char* -    set_proxy_writethrough(cmd_parms *parms, void *dummy, int flag) -{ -    proxy_server_conf *psf = -    ap_get_module_config(parms->server->module_config, &proxy_module); - -    psf->write_through = flag; -    psf->write_through_set = 1; -    return NULL; -}  static const char *      set_proxy_error_override(cmd_parms *parms, void *dummy, int flag)  { @@ -1079,8 +1066,6 @@       'This overrides the server timeout'),      AP_INIT_TAKE1('ProxyBadHeader', set_bad_opt, NULL, RSRC_CONF,       'How to handle bad header line in response: IsError | Ignore | StartBody'), -    AP_INIT_FLAG('ProxyWriteThrough', set_proxy_writethrough, NULL, RSRC_CONF, -     'on if the data should be not be buffered'),       {NULL}  };	add patchavailable keyword. Your patch looks reversed.  You might also want to 'attach' it rather than pasting it in, since the line-wrapping makes your patch very hard to apply. The preferred mechanism would be to AUTOMATICALLY send down a flush bucket if a non-blocking read returns EAGAIN.  No configuration directive would be necessary.  The simplistic algorithm would be    done = 0;   while (!done) {     rv = ap_get_brigade(APR_NONBLOCK_READ);     if (APR_STATUS_IS_EAGAIN(rv)) {         pass flush bucket down output filter chain;         rv = ap_get_brigade(APR_BLOCK_READ);     }     if (rv != APR_SUCCESS) {         done = 1;         break;     }   }  The content-length filter does this, though with a slightly more complicated and optimized algorithm.  In what context do you intend the algorithm to be used?  In proxy_http.c in  place of the change I proposed?   I would think that ordinarily a reverse proxy would want the caching behavior.   Only when tunneling dynamic content would you want to disable the caching.  In  our case, the back end server withholds sending more data until a response is  received on a different socket.  When I originally was researching this I came  across references to people having a similar issue tunneling streaming  multimedia. The logic to hold on to output until we get 8K is not intended to be caching behavior, but instead to send out full packets so that we don't abuse the network.  But if we don't pass flush buckets down at the right time, it breaks some applications that need to send output to the client a piece at a time.  A flush bucket should be passed down when we've read some output but we find out that another read would block.  At this point it is safe to assume that the CGI/origin-server/whatever is not going to generate more output for a while and the output generated so far should be flushed to the client.  This is fixed on HEAD using the method Jeff suggested:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c?r1=1.201&r2=1.202  *** Bug 33029 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Created an attachment (id=19034) patch for httpd-2.0.59  (In reply to comment #8) > Created an attachment (id=19034) [edit] > patch for httpd-2.0.59 >   Guess you provided the reverse patch :-). Furthermore I do not think that this works. The same code does not work in 2.2.x as all non blocking reads are converted to blocking reads somewhere down in the call chain (currently cannot remember where) and thus the conditions in the if clause causing a flush bucket to be added never become true. This is no fault of the proxy code. Either the problem somewhere down the call chain needs to be fixed what seems to be a larger task or we need to use a poll approach here similar to the one currently used in mod_proxy_ajp on the trunk (aka autoflush property of a proxy worker).  After more testing... The patch does not work if Transfer-Encoding is chunked. (See modules/http/http_protocol.c around line 870). Created an attachment (id=19075) patch for httpd-2.0.59 (works also with TE chunked).  Also patch http-protocol to allow the correct to work with TE chunked. From first glance this looks good. Mind to produce a patch against trunk, such that it can be committed and follow the usual backporting process? Created an attachment (id=19091) patch for htttpd-trunk  patch for htttpd-trunk (06/11/2006). +1 on the patch The issue with the chunk filter is a separate issue to the bug in the proxy which was tracked here so please open a new PR if you want that bug tracked.

20111	null	RESOLVED		Sander Holthaus	1053521700000	1101143297000		CGI-script can break error-log When debugging a cgi perl script, all cgi-error-logging broke down. The script  worked flawlessly, but the parameters it outputted through warn's were not  logged.. A graceful or restart did not fix the issue, I had to stop and start Apache to  get it all going again. The strange thing is that only output from cgi's was  broken, 404's were still logged.  I stumbled against this problem a few versions ago too, but was never able to  reproduce the problem.	It seems that stop - start doesn't help either, you need to change the error- logfile (forgot that I did that, sorry). OK, figured it out. The errorlog does not seem to break (eg. other cgi-scripts  and stuff can write to it, no restart neccesary), the bug is caused something I  didn't look at (since is worked in previous versions).  The error-log does not seem to be outputted when writing out a Location header. My script ends with:  print 'Location http://www.mysite.com/succes.html/n/n';  exit;  This code worked up to 2.0.43, but as of 2.0.45 it doesn't. If I quote out this  line I get an error 500 (since nothing is outputted to the browser), but  everything gets written to the error-log.  Was that using an nph- script?  Bug 18348 concerns loss of stderr output from nph- scripts. Ah, no, you had tracked it down correctly.  This is harder to hit with 2.0.50 and later which have the 'CGI bucket' changes, but the remaining case is fixed on the trunk:  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/generators/mod_cgi.c?rev=106195&r1=106103&r2=106195  Thanks for the report.

20183	null	CLOSED		Marcus Janson	1053693840000	1082061841000		ErrorDocument screws up proxied responses other than 200 OK Hi!  In my project we use Apache 2.0.45 as front-end to proxy certain requests to a  backend HTTP server. We also use the ErrorDocument feature of Apache for  predefined error pages.   When using range requests and ErrorDocument in conjunction we see some strange  behaviour, all 20* responses from the backend HTTP server other than 200 OK are  handled as errors by Apache. When the backend HTTP server for example returns a  206 PARTIAL CONTENT the Apache returns the ErrorDocument to the user. This behaviour has been verified by running telnet to port 80 on both Apache  and the HTTP backend server.  I had a quick peek in the code for proxy_http.c and I think I found what's  causing this problem:  (line 984-987) .. if ( conf->error_override ) {     /* the code above this checks for 'OK' which is what the hook expects */     if ( r->status == HTTP_OK)         return OK; ..  I changed the r->status == HTTP_OK to check for 200-206 HTTP responses,  compiled and it seems to work now.   Cheers  /Marcus Janson <-- tre.se -->	Thanks for tracking that down; I've committed a complete fix here:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c?r1=1.183&r2=1.184 I'm reopening this because I'm running into a similar related issue.  I'm using rewrite rules and proxying along with an ErrorDocument to do a load  balancing configuration with failover when the proxy request fails.  If the  proxy can't hit the server and returns a 502, I use an ErrorDocument to force a  redirect to the same URL after changing a cookie that tells it to try another  server out of a rewrite map.   The problem is that the 302 redirect is being treated as an error and  subsequent requests never reach my ErrorDocument handler.  When I read this  report it sounds as if the patch was to treat anything other than 2xx as an  error.  Is a redirect truly an error?  If so, then the only way I can achieve  what I'm attempting is to send a 200 response with a META-REFRESH tag.   I believe the code in http_request.c in ap_die() has the same issue where it  checks if r->status != HTTP_OK. I'm recanting my comments below.  The error I encountered was due to a bad  rewrite rule that generated an additional 502 in the ErrorDocument script.  The  302's are being treated correctly.  Thanks and sorry for reopening this one. 			Byron Guernsey	Joe Orton
20195	null	CLOSED		Liyang HU	1053711840000	1058292068000		per-dir prefix stripping broken without trailing slash Hi,  Say I have the following in my /DocRoot/foo/.htaccess:    RewriteRule (.*) http://another.site/$1 [last,redirect=permanent]  According to the comments around line 1940 of mod_rewrite.c, the local prefix should be stripped from the URI before matching against the pattern. Indeed, http://my.site/foo/bar does get redirected to http://another.site/bar . However, if one tries to access http://my.site/foo , the string comparison in the code fails, resulting in the full path being matched against the pattern. i.e. http://my.site/foo is redirected to http://another.site//DocRoot/foo .  A temporary fix is to special-case this condition in the rewrite rules:    RewriteRule /DocRoot/foo http://another.site/ [last,redirect=permanent]  though this is hardly elegant.  Thanks, /Liyang	Fixed in 2.1 and proposed for inclusion into the 2.0 stable branch.  Thanks for your report and thanks for using Apache!			Andr?? Malo

GetServerVariable() is typically called once with a NULL buffer to establish the required buffer size, then called again with a newly allocated buffer of the appropriate size.  This isn't possible if the first call returns too small a size.  The fix is simple: change '2' to '3' in line 586.	Forgot to mention the file: this is in mod_isapi.c.

Created an attachment (id=6742) Trivial patch  enabling the PatchAvailable keyword updated doc on submitting patches is at http://httpd.apache.org/dev/patches.html  I'd like to see this patch (and those for 20617 and 20619) applied.  All three patches are simple, and I think they're correct and fix errors in the mod_isapi implementation.  Is there anything I can do to facilitate this?  Should I:  - further explain why I believe mod_isapi is currently broken? - bring the patches to someone else's attention? - add votes or keywords? - change priority or severity? - prepare the patch differently?  (I think I got it right.) - provide test code that demonstrates each problem (assuming it's feasible)?  These bugs haven't actually been assigned to anyone; do you need a mod_isapi maintainer?  (Hmm... http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=106854151316221&w=2 may explain a good deal.  Sounds like Bill is just plain busy.) I've looked at the patches previously and ISTR that they looked reasonable to me.  But with zero experience in ISAPI-land I thought it would be best if wrowe have a look ;)  But it is time to move forward, so I'll go through them again and commit what I'm reasonable sure of to Apache 2.1-dev and suggest for a backport.  Thanks for the ping ;)  Sounds good.  Please let me know if you find anything that gets in the way of checking them in; I'm happy to do what I can do address any problems.  The backport should be trivial, since the trunk and 2.0 branch have been kept in sync to the extent possible.  I imagine the real question is whether the maintainers are comfortable with the changes. patch committed to 2.1-dev, thanks!!  will propose shortly that it be merged to the stable branch     +1 on backport here ... if you validated against IIS.  Since ISAPI is an   abandoned API, pretty much defined by 'whatever it is IIS does', I can go   along with this patch.    It might confuse someone on a non-Win32 mod_isapi - but since crlf is   consistent in HTTP headers, I'll agree with Jesse here.  Thanks again :) You're welcome!  I'm glad to see this getting in.  I bumped up against this when header parsing code that worked under IIS didn't work under mod_isapi.  I generated the patch from the change I made to mod_isapi to send headers that I could parse - that is, headers similar to the ones I got from IIS.  I think that's about as much validation as is possible under the circumstances.  (Barring risking your legal neck by looking for IIS source in the recently leaked Windows code, that is.)  Out of curiosity, do you know if anyone is successfully using mod_isapi on a non-Win32 platform? Any progress on backporting this patch and the ones for 20617 and 20619?  It has been a couple of months since 2.0.49 came out; it would be nice if these could make it into 2.0.50, whenever that happens.

21160	null	CLOSED		David Tonhofer	1056769440000	1076412197000		SSL certificate chain handling suddenly fails to work properly There is as yet not much information here, I will have to try a few things first (next week, not today it's about 05:00). But here is what happens:  Apache has been configured with three IP-based virtual servers on three different IP addresses. On each of these addresses, we have an SSL server, thus three SSL servers in total.   One with a self-signed root CA certificate   ROOT->C1->SSL virtual host Two with an 'official' CA certificate        ROOT->C1->C2->SSL virtual host  Everything has been configured, Apache has been happily chugging along...  But then...  After a restart, Apache goes through the SSL virtual servers and asks the password for each of the three private keys (good). After this, it fails (bad) with the following error in the error log:  'Failed to configure CA certificate chain!'  (Some additional info would have been of use, too)  The weird thing is that the configuration for SSL had not changed at all. Thus the production server was suddenly dead in the water w/o reason.  Also, each of the SSL virtual servers work if they are the only ones in the config file. Certain pairs also work, but not all.  Finally, 'openssl verify' does not find anything amiss with the CA chains.  So, that's all for now. More to follow (hopefully)  What is this server:  Apache/2.0.45 + mod_ssl/2.0.45 + OpenSSL/0.9.7b   on a RH7.3 OS with gcc-2.96-110 and glibc-2.2.5-39	As promised, more information (I am actually keeping my word for once, wow!):  I finally got it to work, though why it *does* work is a mystery.  First, some info on what does not work:  I tried the three SSL virtual servers pairwise. On each occasion, Apache startup failed. I got the ide of setting the verbosity level to debug ('LogLevel Debug'), thus we find the following in the logfile, in case all three SSL virtual servers are configured:  [Mon Jun 30 23:03:31 2003] [info] Init: Initializing OpenSSL library [Mon Jun 30 23:03:31 2003] [info] Init: Seeding PRNG with 648 bytes of entropy [Mon Jun 30 23:03:31 2003] [info] Loading certificate & private key of SSL-aware server [Mon Jun 30 23:03:31 2003] [info] Init: Requesting pass phrase via builtin terminal dialog [Mon Jun 30 23:03:38 2003] [debug] ssl_engine_pphrase.c(499): encrypted RSA private key - pass phrase requested [Mon Jun 30 23:03:38 2003] [info] Loading certificate & private key of SSL-aware server [Mon Jun 30 23:03:38 2003] [info] Init: Requesting pass phrase via builtin terminal dialog [Mon Jun 30 23:03:47 2003] [debug] ssl_engine_pphrase.c(499): encrypted RSA private key - pass phrase requested [Mon Jun 30 23:03:47 2003] [info] Loading certificate & private key of SSL-aware server [Mon Jun 30 23:03:47 2003] [info] Init: Requesting pass phrase via builtin terminal dialog [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [debug] ssl_engine_pphrase.c(499): encrypted RSA private key - pass phrase requested [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [info] Init: Wiped out the queried pass phrases from memory [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [info] Init: Generating temporary RSA private keys (512/1024 bits) [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [info] Init: Generating temporary DH parameters (512/1024 bits) [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [debug] ssl_scache_dbm.c(422): Inter-Process Session Cache (DBM) Expiry: old: 0, new: 0, removed: 0 [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [info] Init: Initializing (virtual) servers for SSL [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [info] Configuring server for SSL protocol [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [debug] ssl_engine_init.c(436): Creating new SSL context (protocols: SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1) [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [debug] ssl_engine_init.c(611): Configuring permitted SSL ciphers [ALL:!IDEA:!ADH:EXPORT56:EXPORT40:!NULL:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW] [Mon Jun 30 23:03:54 2003] [error] Failed to configure CA certificate chain!

I figured I would continue with a pair of servers and whittle down the SSL config file until things began to work. This actually paid off!  It turns that the presence of this block seems to be confusing:    <Files ~ '/.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php3?)$'>       SSLOptions +StdEnvVars   </Files>   <Directory '/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin'>       SSLOptions +StdEnvVars   </Directory>  I had this block in each of the three SSL virtual servers, taken from the original file coming with Apache. I commented it out in one (1) of the three.  Lo and behold! It works! Now the passphrase dialog spits out an error after having asked for the 2nd passphrase. This however, does not prevent it from reading the third passpharse. It is also a Good Sign, because whenever this error shows up, the webserver will be able to configure itself:   Server www.m-plify.com:443 (RSA) Enter pass phrase:  Server rei1.m-plify.net:443 (RSA) Enter pass phrase:1024:error:0D094068:asn1 encoding routines:d2i_ASN1_SET:bad tag:a_set.c:179: 1024:error:0D0680A8:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong tag:tasn_dec.c:939: 1024:error:0D07803A:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_ITEM_EX_D2I:nested asn1 error:tasn_dec.c:304:Type=RSA 1024:error:0D09A00D:asn1 encoding routines:d2i_PrivateKey:ASN1 lib:d2i_pr.c:96:   I'm completely at a loss to explain a relationship between the configuration instructions above and SSL certificate chain configuration, sorry....but that's what happened. Naah, forget what I said about the workaround. The exact same file that earlier worked now fails to work (yeah, its the fscking SAME file). This must have to do with the moon phases! OMG...  I have tried with Apache 2.0.46. There were 3 successfull starts and 1  unsuccessful one. Not too bad. I swear I will give up all this Computer Crap and I'm gonna raise sheep in New Zealand!  Anyway, that's it for now. -OO- Same problem here.  A configuration with a certificate chain and two virtual hosts worked on one system (always) but failed on another (always).  On the system where it failed, removing one of the virtual hosts fixed the problem.  Setup: Apache 2.0.46 + OpenSSL 0.9.6i Success system: Gentoo Linux Failure system: RedHat Advanced Server  I'm not sure whether it is related to the OS vendor.  Will do some more checks when I get the time. I have tried with Apache 2.0.47 and openssl-0.9.7b. Same problem.  And the workaround is (tadaa!):  DO NOT ENCRYPT THE SERVER PRIVATE KEYS.  Arf! There is a bug which means the OpenSSL error stack is not cleared: I thought this was a purely cosmetic issue (it causes the error dumps you see during pphrase entry), but in fact it may well be the cause of this bug:  Can anyone who can reproduce this try the following patch:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_pphrase.c?r1=1.44&r2=1.45  I was able to reproduce the 'Failed to configure CA certificate chain' error message.  I started Apache and entered a wrong passphrase for the private key and got 'Error: Pass phrase incorrect (5 more retries permitted).'.  After that I entered the correct passphrase and got 'Ok: Pass Phrase Dialog successful.'.  Then Apache failed to start (the other virtual hosts probably) and the error log contained the certificate chain error.  When I enter the correct passphrase from the beginning everything works allright.  Then I patched the server with the patch given below and retested like above.  Apache now started succesfully.  So it seems that this error stack clearing really is more than only cosmetic :)). Wonderful, thanks Kris.  I've proposed the fix for inclusion in the next 2.0 release.

21285	null	CLOSED		Massimo Torquati	1057168080000	1071782877000		(mem) cache size becomes negative causing segfault Short description:  (mem) cache size becomes negative in some circumstances (caching dynamic objects, small cache size, at least two threads), later causing wrong behaviour and segfault in the cache_insert functions.  Detailed description:  If our understanding of the code is correct, dinamically generated objects are first inserted in the cache as temporary objects with a default size. In the function write_body (in mod_mem_cache.c) to resize a temporary object after it has been completed, it is first removed from cache, and then it is re-inserted with its correct size. This operation is performed withouth checking if the removed object is still present  in the cache. Suppose another thread has removed the temporary object from the cache because of a capacity miss in cache_insert functions (cache_cache.c).  Then you can remove an object of different  size and adjust the cache size in a wrong manner eventually producing a  negative cache size.  A negative cache size quickly produces a segfault in cache_insert().	The problem shows up on only with dynamic object generation. We have tested it using PHP and a small number of simple http clients.  How to reproduce the problem:  Send object requests from some (2-3) clients (I wrote a simple client that at max rate possible connect to server, post a GET request, read reply and close the connection) to a simple php script (code follows) with the cache object count very very small (Es. : MCacheMaxObjectCount 50).   The script produces different small objects (a few bytes in size) based on an input variable (pippo.php?variabile=1234). If you look at the cache size after some time you see it decrease to zero and become negative. Eventually, some of the threads die because of a segfault.  -------- Apache (2.0.46) configure command -------------  ./configure --with-mpm=worker --prefix=/apache-test/ --enable-mods-shared=all --enable-so --enable-cache=shared --enable-mem_cache=shared   ----- Cache configuration -------------  # # Sample Cache Configuration # <IfModule mod_cache.c> <IfModule mod_mem_cache.c> CacheEnable mem / CacheDefaultExpire 1000 CacheMaxExpire 3000 CacheIgnoreCacheControl Off CacheIgnoreNoLastMod    On MCacheSize 2000 MCacheMaxObjectCount 50 MCacheMinObjectSize 1 MCacheMaxObjectSize 1048576 </IfModule> </IfModule>  ---- php script code (pippo.php) ---- <?php  header('Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 2005 05:00:00 GMT'); echo '<head>  </head>'; echo '<html> <br> html part <br> </html>'; if (isset($_GET['variabile'])) {  echo 'mi hai passato '.$_GET['variabile']; } else { echo 'non mi hai passato niente'; } ?> Created an attachment (id=7067) proposed patch for bug 21285 and bug 21287  The patch corrects the bugs 21285 and the bug 21287.   I think there are cleaner ways to remove bug 21285; perhaps the simplest one is to mark temporary objects in the cache as not removable. This clearly has consequences on the removing algorithm as well, though.  In the meanwhile, the patch I propose works well to eliminate the problem, and has been extensively tested in the same settings with version 2.0.44 and 2.0.46 .

A MSIE Internet Explorer is handling that kind of re-negotiation in  the following way: a) he is finishing the current handshake (see logfile) b) afterwards he is starting a new handshake, now presenting a     client certificate  So the whole situation is handeld by mod_ssl in the following way: 1) mod_ssl is starting a re-negotiation 2) the client does not finish the handshake (see a) ) 3) mod_ssl is freeing the SSL struct using 'SSLfree(..)'    (By that also the allocated BIO's will be freed) 4) the browser is starting a new handshake (see b) ), using the same    TCP connection (Keep-Alive is enabled) and so the already     freed SSL struct and BIO's will be used by mod_ssl    (Due to the fact that it is bound to the conn_rec struct)  I.e. mod_ssl is reading already freed memory.  We have proven is using a (purify Version 2002a.06.00 an Solaris 2.8)   Fix: If the handshake is failing in 'ssl_io_filter_connect(..)' the connection  will be aborted.  Due to stability the pointer's to the BIOS will be reset in  in 'ssl_filter_io_shutdown(..)' and check in 'ssl_filter_write(..)' We have tested the fix again with the same memory access checker.

21371	null	CLOSED		Mark Webb	1057584480000	1063716229000		apache not passing certificate chain to servlet or CGI I have been working on a site that enforces mutually authenticated SSL using apache 2.0.46. I have compiled it from source using the following commands passed to the ./configure script:  ./configure --enable-so --enable-ssl --with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl  /usr/local/ssl contains openssl version 0.9.7b which I compiled from source using the default build configuration. I have tried both servlets and cgi and all I can get is the user certificate, not the certificate chain.  I have tried looking at the mod_ssl code, and cannot figure out why the +ExportCertData directive will only tell apache to forward on the user certificate, not the chain.	This is all Greek to me (i.e., it would take me a long time to figure out how to test), but it looks like there is an off-by-one error in ssl_engine_vars.c that messes up the lookup of the cert chain info.  I'll attach a patch to test in just a sec.  The latest mod_ssl for Apache 1.3 has this change too.  I'd wager that backtracking that line of code in prior releases of the original mod_ssl would show that it got fixed after we imported it into Apache 2.0.  Created an attachment (id=7231) proposed fix for cert chain variable problem  The patch posted previously has been committed to Apache 2.1-dev and proposed for merge to 2.0.48-dev.  I tried the patch and got the same results.  I do not think that the patch fixed the problem. Then I suppose more changes are required :(  The change in the patch corrected a blatant error which has also been fixed in the mod_ssl project for 1.3.  Do you have any setup hints for testing this scenario?  Perhaps you can point to some documentation?  This is what I do...  to compile apache(2.0.47).  I am using openSSL 0.9.7b, compiled from source, and installed in /usr/local/ssl. ./configure --enable-so --enable-ssl --with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl gmake  gmake install  to configure apache create a test cert for apache, set up ssl.conf properly. open browser, point to test-cgi. observe that certificate chain is not listed in the output.  This proves to me that the certificate chain is not being passed to the CGI, and therefore would not be passed to a servlet either.  I am most interested in getting apache to pass the entire certificate chain to a servlet, but am using cgi's to test with right now.  This is because it is easier to test, and takes the tomcat connector stuff out of the equation.  Please let me know what more help I may be. I'm stuck at the point of getting a certificate chain passed from the client.  (No idea how to do that yet :) ).  I see SSL_CLIENT_CERT being set but with the following patch to one of the mod_ssl files I see that OpenSSL is telling mod_ssl that there are zero certificates in the chain.  Try testing with this patch to see if OpenSSL has provided mod_ssl with a chain. If it hasn't, you'll see something like I did:  [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1064): [client 9.65.78.133] got peer certificate chain (0/8245458/8252f50)  where the 0 after 'chain (' is the number of certificates in the chain returned by OpenSSL...

I use mod_disk_cache to cache static files delivered by Tomcat via mod_jk. Unfortunately you did not write if you are caching local files or remote files (delivered by mod_jk, mod_proxy or something similar).  I noticed that when you abort the download of a file which should be cached and whos origin is on a remote server, the partly downloaded file gets cached. The second request for this file only delivers the partly cached file and thus leads to the problems described by you. In my case the problem showed up by incomplete jpg pictures.  The reason for this behaviour can be found in mod_disk_cache. mod_disk_cache does not notice that a request has been aborted. I wrote a small patch (against 2.0.50) that drops the partly cached file if the connection has been aborted.  Unfortunately the CacheForceCompletion of mod_cache is not implemented right now such that nearly completely downloaded files get lost for the cache. But this is better than delivering only parts of the files in the following requests. Created an attachment (id=12516) Proposed Patch  Can you please test this in 2.0.51?  Lots of fixes for mod_disk_cache were made. I checked this with 2.0.51 and it is only partially fixed. It should work with local files, but it does not work if the length of the content to be cached is unknown and the file is large as it is the case if you cache large dynamic content originally created by Tomcat. And this is what I am doing. I try to lower the load on the Tomcats by caching large files generated by Tomcat that are valid for some time via mod_cache on the webserver.   The problem is that in this case we get to line 663 of mod_disk_cache.c as the condition in line 661 is true in any case (content written completely to file or only partially because the connection has been aborted). So this operation is handled as successful caching of the request in any case even if the content was only saved partially.   Nevertheless the changes to mod_disk_cache provide an better environment now for the needed changes so I provide an updated version of my patch for 2.0.51. Created an attachment (id=12847) Patch for 2.0.51  A variant of the 'patch for 2.0.51' has been committed to HEAD as modules/experimental/mod_disk_cache.c rev 1.64.  Thanks! Backported to v2.0.53.

Hoping this is a real bug and not just a problem of my system. I tested it with SuSE 8.1 and Debian 2.0.  Greetings from Germany, Kai Seidler	I can verify this problem with ab from Apache 2.1-dev on RedHat 8.  Interestingly, apr_poll() hasn't changed in some time.  And yet ab hasn't changed its use of socket I/O in some time either.  Go figure :)  Apparently the use of poll in ab is broken, as polling only for POLLIN is only going to catch failures to connect.

Yes, it works for me as well. Thanks a lot, Jeff! For the record:  While the patch I posted apparently makes it work, it is something of a kludge.  ab in 2.0.46 worked because of the way that apr_connect() was broken for purely non-blocking sockets.  One would think that the poll condition between the initial connect call and when we know we've successfully found a partner would be simply POLLOUT, but it doesn't work unless you have POLLOUT|POLLIN because the connect state is used for more than just getting connected to the desired remote part.  Another issue is that we don't reissue the connect to find out whether or not it worked.  But that isn't so easy because connect state is overloaded with some SSL setup.  Maybe the kludge isn't so bad, since it may be some time before somebody feels like cleaning house in ab and potentially breaking something else :)  *** Bug 22686 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** A fix for this will be in 2.0.48.

Here's part of the transmission that I've managed to log. Begin client request: POST http://cimserv.1stsi.com/fans/dsasoapserver.php Accept: text/xml Accept: multipart/* Accept-Encoding: deflate User-Agent: SOAP::Lite/Perl/0.55 Content-Encoding: deflate Content-Length: 327 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 SOAPAction: 'http://cimserv#check'  <snip out contents of requests>  Begin server response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Connection: Close Date: Fri, 11 Jul 2003 16:29:13 GMT Server: NuSOAP Server v0.6.4 Vary: Accept-Encoding Content-Encoding: deflate, gzip Content-Length: 267 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8 Client-Date: Fri, 11 Jul 2003 16:31:04 GMT Client-Peer: 172.16.104.14:80 Status: 200 OK X-Powered-By: PHP/4.3.2  <snip out the contents of response>   One thing is for sure, I definitely didn't add ', gzip' to the server's response. Strange thing though... it happens on and off.	First: please try 2.0.47, which contains some further fixes. Second: I can't believe, that mod_deflate compresses gzip if Accept-Encoding: contains no gzip. I'd guess the compression takes place somewhere else. Hi, sorry for the cross post. Anyway I'm sure it is a mod_deflate problem as  everything works fine for the last 5 hours after I try the work around as  describe in bug 9222. My problem would normally appear every now and then  within an hour or two. I will try Apache 2.0.47 later on and see if I get the  same problem. Ok I've upgraded to 2.0.47 this morning. I've done the tests with 5 SOAP::Lite  clients sending 500 various types of requests(both valid and errorneous) each  and without any special setenvif settings, and none of the server responses are  gzipped. Looks great. Just curious, how come the 2.0.47 release didn't mention  anything about fixing mod_deflate.. or was this problem attributed to other  Apache components? Thanks. Oops... In fact,the changes were made in 2.0.46. Strange. This points to other sources of error as well, IMHO. I'll close the report for now. Don't hesitate to reopen it, if there are further issues.  Thanks for using Apache! Created an attachment (id=7491) Loop test log file  Looks like I spoke too soon. I'm attaching the complete log file of my most recent loop test.  Hmm. The point is, mod_deflate only gets active, if the filter (DEFLATE) is added *and* Accept-Encoding contains the gzip token. Did you add the filter somehow? What's the particular configuration? Here are my settings for the filters.  <Directory />     Options FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride None Order Deny,Allow  Deny from all  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/ms* application/vnd*  application/postscript </Directory>  # DeflateFilterNote Input instream DeflateFilterNote Output outstream DeflateFilterNote Ratio ratio   LogFormat '%h %l %u %t /'%r/' %>s %b /'%{Referer}i/' /'%{User-Agent}i/' In:% {instream}n Out:%{outstream}n:%{ratio}npct' comdef  Oh by the way.. the workaround in bug 9222 doesn't work either... the problem  still happens intermittently. Well, and it does actually log instream/outstream/ratio for these requests? I'll attach the access logs once I return from work.

Ok I just tried what was recommended.. and I hit it again. Here is the output  of the log.  127.0.0.1 - - [25/Jul/2003:23:35:52 +0800] 'POST /testsoap.php HTTP/1.1' 200  268 '-' 'SOAP::Lite/Perl/0.55' In:245 Out:250:102pct 'deflate' 'deflate, gzip'  Here's the logformat from my httpd.conf  LogFormat '%h %l %u %t /'%r/' %>s %b /'%{Referer}i/' /'%{User-Agent}i/' In:% {instream}n Out:%{outstream}n:%{ratio}npct /'%{Accept-Encoding}i/' /'%{Content- Encoding}o/'' comdef Created an attachment (id=7518) accept-encoding parsing fix  I may be on a wild goose chase, but can you try that patch? Sorry, unfortunately I don't have any compilers with me right now on my Windows  system and at home. Is there something like a nightly build I could run my  tests against? Any chances of this being fixed in 2.0.48? Ha, Joe, you've found the problem! We skip the /0 delimiter and search somewhere in the memory... Therefore it occurs *sometimes*.

The error_log just says     Negotiation: discovered file(s) matching request: /bla/test (None could be negotiated).  (if requested by /test, would be /bla/test.html if requested by /test.html). This message BTW doesn't make any sense to me, how can files be discovered that do not exist?  This happens only if a file extension is mapped to a handler or filter only. The default SSI setup with both text/html and INCLUDES mapped to .shtml works.  I initally discovered this while trying to get content negotiation working with different PHP output types like style.css.php or index.html.php. Some browsers request _exactly_ what they expect, so using AddType to link .php to text/html or -even worse IMHO- application/x-php-whatever does not work with files different than text/html or even text/html in the later case (which is unfortunatly the standard, recommended PHP setup). And apart from that it doesn't make any sense to me to declare .php internally as text/html (or whatever other type) anyway if the script in fact outputs a PNG image.  Nevertheless, this bug is not related to PHP, as seen with the SSI example above. Just wanted to point out that there is a justified use for this.  This bug might be related to #16328.	Hmm, did you try using the MultiViewsMatch directive? I bet this will solve that problem. MultiViewsMatch works, thanks. Maybe Apache 2's defaults should follow more closely to the paths Apache 1 set? hmm. IIRC that was a design decision, because of *better* defaults...  There is also ia note at <http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/upgrading.html>. Should we place it additionally somewhere else? About the 'better defaults': I do agree that selecting forgotten .old or .bak files by negotiation is surely not what the site maintainer wants, but if there is something (read: handler or filter) mapped to an extension, why not choose it? Looks to me like the developers did a step too far, instead of selecting too much, negotiation now selects too few. And that 'too much' wasn't a big problem anyway (IMHO of course:).  But apart from that, a short note about the changed behaviour on the mod_negotiation page would be helpful. Maybe I should add that any description of the new behaviour _at all_ would be nice. There's not a single word in the mod_negotiation docs about excluding handlers/filters and un-MIME-fied files by default; nutpickers could even argue that the current Multiviews description is wrong as it just lists the 'client's requirements', which 'to handle or not to handle' is surely not part of :)  A 'See also: MultiViewsMatch' should be there, too.  Mmh, reopening as documentation bug. In a large part I agree with you.  But the idea behind the change is that mod_negotiation is meant for content-negotiation.  Using MultiViews to omit the extension really has very little to do with negotiation.  But I'll go add a couple notes to the docs to improve this.  Thanks for using Apache!			Andr??

This has been observed on move then 5 servers.	Created an attachment (id=7406) reverse what happened in 1.3.28  I've been having the same problem.  Please try that patch I attached.   The problem is that when running under suexec you cannot send the process sigterm since apache and the script are running with diffrent uids.  Apache 1.3.28 beleives the process is dead because the kill failed and sets p_kill_how=kill_never.  It really should look for -ESRCH. Created an attachment (id=7407) instead of reverse ... fix  The second patch implements a fix instead of reverting things back to the way 1.3.27 handled things. This probably should be critical as it causes servers to crash. *** Bug 21739 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I don't think the patch works (either of them). Still got new defuncts. However I tested on one server only. sorry about severity change, new to bugzilla.  (altho I haven't experience any crushs on 7 servers some with multiple instances of apache). Can you get it to reliably create a defunct process by doing the following?  > a) Put a this script in your cgi-bin > --cut here-- > #!/usr/bin/php > <?php phpinfo(); ?> > --cut here-- >  > b) Go to it your web browser.  Click reload over and over again (this > will eventually cause a sigpipe).  >  > c) watch the zombies build up The problem is fixed, I forgot I had another apache on that server. sorry for extra work I caused. Just to confirm, the patched apache is working correctly? *** Bug 21746 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I'm not sure now. I manualy patched (with the second patch) few servers and they look fine, one cpanel server (with the first patch) still defuncts. not sure yet if it's me of the patch. second cpanel defuncts. second patch also defuncts. so to sum it, the patches don't work. I can create a defunct process with the script above and get it about 80% of the time. The defunct process is gone very quickly now. You should probably still get defunct processes (the same thing happens in 1.3.27 and below), but they shouldn't exist for more then 5 or so seconds cause there is still a wait time between the time sigpip is recieved and the timeout.  This should be ok though. > You should probably still get defunct processes (the same thing happens in > 1.3.27 and below), but they shouldn't exist for more then 5 or so seconds  cause > there is still a wait time between the time sigpip is recieved and the  timeout.  Oh no! The defunct-processes won't clean automaticly! John:  do you still see them lingering after using the patch? Just so you know, we (the dev team) have seen this bug report and are looking into it.  Thanks  for the detailed investigation!  The patch does not help! This appears to be the modified PHP-suexec patch you have that is broken.  Note  this is likely only a problem for users that use Cpanel and the Apache version  with the newly updated alloc.c patch--looking at it, it is a source of more  problems.  You are looking in the wrong place.  The php-suexec patch that I've  modified myself and use with Apache 1.3.28 does not suffer from these problems  at all.  I believe that is the cause of your problems and your alloc.c patch  causes more (look at the modifications to see why!)  Maybe I'm wrong, but this  is how it appears looking at the patch and the alloc.c patch as well seems to  cause yet more issues. I.e., it's ignoring -USR1 hup's and so on, which is also conflicting with your  control panel on new account set ups and so on, which is causing more users to  submit reports about this version of Apache having this bug, which beyond the  PHP-SuEXEC patch and the messed up alloc.c patch, doesn't exist (*from what I've  seen*--I may be wrong, but it _is_ a source of additional problems). While I have actually been able to confirm this on .28 with the PHP-suexec patch  under specific circumstances--I am not able to reproduce the problem for .28 nor  .27 without that patch being implemented.  Has anyone experienced this issue that is not using the PHP suexec patch from  http://www.localhost.nl/patches/ (or a similar source), be it a modified version  of this patch or not?  I.e., the problem exists on installs without this?  I've  not been able to reproduce it without this patch being implemented.  Either way, the alloc.c patch is not the solution, at least not a complete  solution and opens up other problems, with some tests.  More information about  that later, if it's needed. Not sure why the comments I added is not in.  I can confirm the problem as well. My setup is stock apache1.3.28 (no php-suexec path) with modssl 2.8.15-1.3.28 and php 4.3.2. A simple test script that only display 'hello world' will stay as a defunct process owned by the suExec user. The defunct process only went away after a restart of the apache processes. Odd, I've not been able to recreate this on non 'PHP for CGI w/ SuEXEC' patched  systems, but I sincey you experience it as well, I personally assume it relates  to CGI and SuEXEC.  Has anyone confirmed this on non-SuEXEC enabled installs? I'm not sure why the first patch would cause USR1 not to work.  The patch just reverts parts of alloc.c to 1.3.27.    I was mistaken.  This was not related.  The patch did cause other problems  though.  I will attempt to recreate the problem in various ways and report it in  the very near future.  However, since this doesn't seem to be the overall  solution and more of a quick fix, I suppose there's no need. Which patch are you using?  The first one or the second one.    I've reviewed the second one:  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=7407  and I can't see how it could cause a problem.   I'm not so sure about the first one though. I confirm the bug for Apache 1.3.28/mod_ssl-2.8.15-1.3.28/php-4.3.1 running on OpenBSD 3.2. The fix (7407) seems to be working here. I applied the patch 7407 and it seems to fix the problem. Now the suEXEC process no longer stayed in zombie state. *** Bug 21926 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** with the second patch:  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=7407  seems to be ok.  I got some defunct process butthey are killed in few seconds. Looks good, thanks.  We had severe zombie problems as well after upgrading to 1.3.28 (on Solaris  2.8). Compiling with the second (7407) patch solved the zombie problem for us  as well. This second 'patch' is just reverting back to the alloc.c file for .27 instead  of .28.  Has anyone noted any impact due to this?  This does seem to help, but  not completely remove the issue.  Also, bypassing the function(s) in .28--does  this matter?  It seems to be a logic error. The first patch is the one that revents, the second one is the one that should fix the problem with keeping the current logic. s/revents/reverts (gee 1am) I meant first, not second. :-) What will happen with this patch in the future? Will this be part of 1.3.29 or  will it become an official patch? We like to know that before we start  upgrading all our other apache 1.3.27 instances. Though I am not the person that would authorize anything as official or have  any control over what Apache does, and I don't personally assume this would be  implemented in .29 or be official (what do I know), I still recommend you  upgrade to .28 and implement this patch if you find you have to (or create some  solution yourself that maybe you feel more comfortable with otherwise).  You  don't want to stick with .27 at this point anyway. For me, patch 7407 works like a dream. I have yet to see any zombie processes  with my PHP script or with the 'phpinfo()' script mentioned above. Before, I  could reproduce the zombies quite easily - about 50% of the time with my script  and 100% of the time with the 'phpinfo()' script.  BTW, I'm not using any 'PHP-suexec' patch. Hi Jordan,  I'm curious, do you have suexec enabled?  If so, do you have this problem  without it enabled? Sorry if that sounded obvious to ask, given the history of the reports. :-) Yes, I use suexec.  I just tested the phpinfo() script on a virtual site that does NOT use suexec,  and I get no zombies while holding down the browser's Refresh key (F5 in  Internet Explorer).  When the same script is run on a suexec site, I get about 10 zombies per second  (great potential for DoS?). Patch 7407 fixes this for me. How about on a build without suexec compiled in as an option, rather than a  site without it enabled on a build that has it?  I'm just testing out a few  thoeries that likely have little to do with your problem, but I'd like to see if  anyone sees this on a non-suexec build... and if so, how long they take to die  off.  If you don't mind anyway.  Thanks. I tested the phpinfo() script on a 1.3.28 server that doesn't have suexec  compiled in, and got no zombies. Ralf S. Engelschall posted a different patch on apache-http-dev: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=105952652425849&w=2  Is that patch better than 4707?  Either one should work just as well Yes, it would be a better overall patch, though, as he stated himself, the  original one works, but could be improved--which it seems it was.  I'd recommend  using this other patch by Ralf overall. The FreeBSD port apache13-modssl (Apache 1.3.28 + ModSSL 2.8.15) has been  updated to include the 4707 patch. My server with heavy CGI (Perl and PHP) was  creating zombies left and right, about 5000/hour.  I like the 4707 patch. It made me happy again. This patch does not work for me. I'm using suEXEC, mod_ssl compiled as a DSO, mod_frontpage_mirfak, mod_gzip, mod_pointer, and mod_throttle, all compiled as DSO modules. I should note that the patch given on the mailing list works fine. This is the patch that actually got committed (yesterday):  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apache-1.3/src/main/alloc.c.diff?r1=1.145&r2=1.146  It is slightly different than the patches that were posted to the mailing list, but it addresses all known concerns.   I applied the patch for alloc.c as is in the CVS tree to a APACHE_1_3_27 source.  I failed to correct  the problem for me under Mac OS X 10.3... investigating further... I have confirmed, this condition still exists on Mac OS X 10.3 with this patch.  I patched the 1.3.28  sources (I erred in my comment above).  And was still able to reproduce this.  I did extensive further testing and found that both Mac OS X, and FreeBSD violate the POSIX  specification for kill() and return ESRCH, when sending a signal to a zombie process.  This violation introduces a race condition with this patched code, as a process could finish (become  zombie) after the NEED_WAITPID 'waitpid' cleanup, but before the ap_os_kill() call and thus return  ESRCH, be marked as kill_never, and then never be cleaned up.  Although it is my hope that Mac OS X 10.3 final will have fixed this error.  Apache is still left with  an interoperability problem on Mac OS X 10.2 and likely FreeBSD (as they share this same  violoation).  I have attached my program 'main.c' which tests for this phenomenon. Created an attachment (id=8055) A program to test errno after signal to zombie process.  Thinking about this a little more... I think there are two options here:  1.  Come up with a solution, not dependant on this behaviour of kill...  (moving the waitpid to after  the kill call should be sufficient?)  2.  Add a configure.in rule to check for the POSIX compliance to kill and conditionally deal with it's  compliance or non-compliance accordingly.  There may be other systems (besides OS X and  FreeBSD) which have this ESRCH behaviour when sending to zombies... Here is a 'hack' which fixes the problem on Mac OS X (likely FreeBSD as well).  -           if (ap_os_kill(p->pid, SIGTERM) == -1) { +           if ( (ap_os_kill(p->pid, SIGTERM) == -1) && (errno == ESRCH) ) { +               // in case ESRCH means 'zombie'. +                waitpid(p->pid, (int *) 0, 0); Unless I'm mistaken, can't kill return EPERM for setuid processes?  Wouldn't that also leak? Another data point: I received an e-mail from a Tru64 user indicating that the patch as committed failed there too, and that Ralf's patch worked fine. Because of the bogusness of how some OSs handle errors from KILL, I've changed us to simply kill  and wait. 			147099.vserver.de	Ari Pollak	Christian Noack	Cliff Woolley	Eric Seidel	Erin Fortenberry	EvE	J.

21779	null	CLOSED		Roy Gibbons	1058813820000	1073769763000		Need to reject malformed href strings send by webdav client I have encountered two problems in using the Web Folders in XP Pro to manipulate files hosted on a webdav-enabled webserver.  The server is apache2.0.47 with the mod_dav modules and runs under linux.  The first problem is that XP does not escape the '#' character with a '%23' as part of the path segment.  This is a MicroSoft bug in XP as the Win2K version seems to be better behaved.  The more serious problem is that the Apache server does not reject such a request and but processes it with some nasty results.  In the following example, an authorized client/user has DELETE priviledges on the webdav server.  The test file is  called '/websites/davtest/#dav_test.html' which is a valid filename in linux, unix and MacOS worlds but not in Windows.  When the DELETE submission is made by a Cadaver client or a Win2K client, the following command is issued to the server     'DELETE /websites/davtest/%23dav_test.html HTTP/1.1' everything works as it should.  However, when a DELETE submission is made by XP Pro, the server receives     'DELETE /websites/davtest/#23dav_test.html' which is doesn't escape the # character.  The server accepts the command and proceeds to delete the following     #23dav_test.html     all files in the /davtest directory     the parent directory (davtest).  A server-based solution seems to be in order.  Thanks	Thanks for the report - it is simple enough to reject these requests. *** Bug 22023 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I have a simple patch for this, where it checks non-null condition for 'r->parsed_uri.fragment'.

22030	null	RESOLVED		Brandon Black	1059679920000	1097735043000		4097+ bytes of stderr from cgi script causes script to hang If a cgi script under mod_cgi outputs more than 4096 bytes of stderr before it  finishes writing to and closing its stdout, the write() inthe cgi script  containing the 4097th byte of stderr will hang indefinitely, hanging the  script's execution.  This appears to be cause by the fact that mod_cgi reads all stdout output  first, and then begins reading stderr output.  APR's file_io which is handling  the streams will only buffer 4096 characters before further writes by the  script to stderr will hang, waiting for mod_cgi to read some of the data from  the stream via APR file_io.  This occured for me where a perl cgi script was producing a large volume of  harmless warning messages to ssl_error_log before it got to the part of it's  execution where it actually wrote the stdout output, and causing the script to  hang and produce no output to the end user.  Below is a test script to  demonstrate:  #!/usr/bin/perl # 24x170 = 4080 bytes to stderr foreach my $x (1..24) {   print STDERR 'X' x 169 . '/n'; } # + 17 more bytes, putting us at 4097 # Delete one char from the print below to make # it work again print STDERR '0123456789ABCDEF/n'; # Our actual script output, which never comes print 'Content-type: text/plain/n/nASDF/n';	*** Bug 22318 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 22900 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** This DoS vulnerability has been tickin me off for two months now.  The CGI is blocked on a write() to stderr trying so hard to shove the packet  down Apache's throat and httpd is blocked waiting for something from the CGI's  stdout, which will never happen until that stderr is consumed, which also  never happens.  My system gets hundreds of processes with httpd and the CGI script deadlocked  with each other because if this issue.  I have to restart apache regularly to  avoid grinding the server to a pulp from wasted processes or 'Out of memory'  errors. But mostly it just reaches MaxClients all the time which prevents new  hits from being allowed (thus creating a DoS on my machine).  I'm surprised mod_cgi was already known to be borked in this way and not  repaired yet in the cvs source tree.  Anyone with cvs write access to the httpd repository, I'm begging you to try  to fix this.    I bricked over modules/generators/mod_cgi.c with Jeff Trawic's version:    http://www.apache.org/~trawick/mod_cgi.c    And suddenly all the problems vanished on my linux box.  Thank you Jeff!    Is there any reason why this is not incorporated into the httpd trunk source  tree?  Does it break non *NIX platforms?  If so, would it be appropriate to at  least do something like the following:    #ifdef LINUX  (new version)  #endif  #ifndef LINUX  (old version)  #endif    Rolling back to Apache 1.3.28 also eliminates all these problems, but I cannot  keep running 1.3.x because I need to use the new version of mod_php which is  not supported as well on the old apache.    Diff the old mod_cgi and new mod_cgi leads to a number of changes.  It would be great if we could  get an idea from the developers any pitfalls they may see with going up with the new mod_cgi.  Is  it safe to run on production?? Yes, the files seem quite different.  So many changes in fact that I got too  bored (or lazy) to review everything.  I just used blind faith and replaced  the whole file.  I'm not sure if anyone is using it on production, but it  certainly works fine on my development system.  I am going to roll it out on  my production system now.  It can't be any worse than the old one!  FYI: I just figured out how to buttwag around this bug until it can be  repaired.  Just force everyone to put this line at the top of all the perl  scripts:    use IO::Handle; STDERR->blocking(0);    Everything after the first 4096 bytes to stderr will be dropped, but at least  the server never falls into deadlock between the httpd and the CGI script.     That's a great idea, maybe I can put that in CGI.pm or something.  But I have over 2000 perl  scripts!! :-)   problems with ~/trawick/mod_cgi.c:  1) buffers up the response, which is really uncool and breaks with cgis that need to flush or which write huge responses  the code to parse http headers written by the cgi needs to be changed to get rid of the buffering  handle_script_stdout() needs to know when we've seen all the headers, then process them, then set ctx->headers_processed  2) doesn't work on the ever-lame win32  groan  3) needs the last few fixes to mod_cgi integraded  4) doesn't help mod_cgid, which is needed by threaded MPMs  5) isn't tested a whole lot  but of course you folks are helping with that  --/--  The main problem to attack is #1...  with that solved, everything else is not so hard, other than Win32, which doesn't have to be solved.  I'll try to attack #1 now that I see some interest in it.  Alternately, somebody else play with it in a debugger and see what I mean about needing to recognize when we've read the entire response header from the CGI and can get into the simple mode where we pass all output down the filter chain as soon as we read it. *** Bug 10515 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 23473 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** This bug was issued as an Apache DOS vulnerability in a Symantec Security release yesterday. They  cite going with the latest CVS release as a workaround.    Jeff can you provide some guidance on whether  http://www.apache.org/~trawick/mod_cgi.c or  the latest CVS rev will be the most stable release.  I notice several diffs between the CVS version  and the one in your home dir.  Thanks! There is no fix in CVS for this problem.  There is no stable mod_cgi[d] that handles 4097+ bytes from stderr mixed in with stdout processing.  I don't recommend using any of the code in http://www.apache.org/~trawick/ in a production environment.  I just uploaded jcgi.tar to www.apache.org/~trawick/.  Module was renamed to mod_jcgi so that hopefully it doesn't get confused with real code from CVS. This has fewer big picture problems than the mod_cgi.c hacks I had before, and of course anyone is free to play with it and comment.  See included STATUS file for some notes.  For production users: if your CGI spews gobs of stuff to stderr, change the CGI for now.  For folks debugging CGIs and want to have them temporarily spew gobs of stuff to stderr, play with the hacked up version mentioned here and send me testcases for stuff that doesn't work.  As always, anybody should feel free to make alternate changes to the real mod_cgi[d] and submit patches to dev@httpd.apache.org.  I raised this bug a long while back (Sep 25, 2002, actually: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=103291952019514&w=2) and suggested a new 'CGI bucket' type that kept both stdout and stderr descriptors from the CGI process. When the bucket read() function is called, it would select() across both descriptors. Content from stdout would spawn a new bucket, and content from stderr would be logged.  Then wrowe went off with a crazy super-solution which caused a total loss of focus on the practical problems.  My suggestion still stands: have mod_cgi(d) inject a new CGI_BUCKET into the filter stack which can drain both streams. No more hangs. Ever. No buffering. Works for both cgi implementations. Works on Windows (presumably, since we're using standard apr functions to poll across the two descriptors). mod_cgid does not have this particular hang problem because the script's stderr refers directly to the error log.  Note that mod_cgid has some other issues with error log, but they are of lesser significance.  The two I can think of are:  + writing to syslog doesn't work + the main error log is always used, instead of the vhost-specific error log  (there are entries in this bug database already for these issues)  Regarding Greg's comments about a special CGI bucket type being produced by mod_cgi:  There is another issue to solve with mod_cgi[d] that exists in 1.3 as well: hangs will occur if all body data isn't read first, before the script starts producing output.  Clearly this isn't something that many scripts have encountered, but solving this enables some interesting CGI behavior.  My own work on this problem has been to handle all three channels (script's stdin -- request body, stdout, and stderr) right in mod_cgi.  Sending a special CGI bucket down the filter chain to solve the stdout/stderr problem doesn't deal with writing request body to the script as the script can handle it.  With the I/O handled directly in mod_cgi, an extra channel doesn't need a different model.  An unfortunate problem to solve regardless of where stderr is read is that APR doesn't support polling on pipes on Win32.  In the long term hopefully some Win32 gurus will provide a workable solution, but in the short term special handling is required.  (See APR_FILES_AS_SOCKETS.)  For what it's worth, this is proving to be a real problem for us attempting to migrate to apache 2.0 from 1.3 on UNIX (linux).  Is anyone actively looking at this or has it fallen off the radar? Carl, you can try http://www.apache.org/~trawick/jcgi.tar  Thanks Jeff, is this likely to make it into 2.0.49?  I'm pretty keen on sticking to production releases on our production servers :) definitely not going to make it to 2.0.49 *nod*.  This ticket's been open for some time now (some 4 months), do you know if/when it may be fixed in the release?  2.0.50? :) Is there any news at all on when this bug might get fixed please? Thanks. Scroll up from the bottom of the PR to find an alternate mod_cgi which has a redesigned interaction with the script.  Little or no feedback on that so far.  Thanks Jeff. I gave jcgi a very quick spin a couple of months ago but didn't manage to make it work (although I didn't try that hard at the time). I will try again sometime soon and see if I have any more luck.  How urgent is fixing this bug viewed as by those who are actively working on Apache? Obviously to me it seems pretty important because it breaks all my scripts (although I'm sure that it could be argued that my scripts are at fault for sending so much to stderr) but I don't really have that much knowledge of the internals of Apache and what other issues are outstanding against it at the moment. Are we likely to see a proper fix for this included in a production release in the foreseeable future or will work arounds within scripts and fixes like Jeff's be the norm for now? I have to agree with Jeff.   Having the server to hang with no explanation when your error output reaches some magic threshold is hopeless broken. It is the type of problem that won't show up in testing, but will break after deployment.   This is a 'I can't trust Apache 2.0' problem. >How urgent is fixing this bug viewed as by those who are actively working on Apache?  Emperical evidence would suggest that it is not very important.  >Are we likely to see a proper fix for this included in a production >release in the foreseeable future or will work arounds within scripts >and fixes like Jeff's be the norm for now?  I have no idea about the first question.  The answer to the second question is, in general, no.  This particular situation is one which requires a complete redesign of how mod_cgi interacts with scripts.  I have made a set of code available which for Unix has a design that should solve this problem, it works for my testcases, etc.  Another unusual example: 2.0.49 provided an overhaul of mod_include with completely new parsing engine and a number of existing problems resolved.  For quite a while, people with 2.0.x  mod_include problems were asked to try this alternate implementation.  After a relatively long time it was merged into 2.0.x for the 2.0.49 release.  If somebody has time/energy to move the ball forward they can offer their own solution or try out what I have and offer feedback.  If somebody does not have time/energy to help move the ball forward they can always buy commercial support for Apache or an Apache-based server and complain to the vendor that it does not meet their requirements.  Or modify scripts to redirect stderr or not output so much stuff to stderr. My lame workaround has been to start all my CGIs by re-opening STDERR to a plain file: open(STDERR, '>>/tmp/error.log').  Yuck.  Without that hack, this is bug a show-stopper for me too - there's no way I could deploy httpd2 on a system with CGIs I don't 100% trust (e.g. the shared webserver we virtualhost all our customer's webs on). How about taking the simpler 'CGI bucket' approach for a lower risk change to incorporate into 2.0 than the fundamental rewrite:  - fix just the regression since 1.3 (not the issue of handling stdin too) - simple #if APR_FILES_AS_SOCKETS to avoid breaking Win32  I have a patch to implement this based largely on mod_jcgi and the existing apr_buckets_pipe.c.

22061	null	RESOLVED		Eloi Granado	1059754380000	1104427460000		About alias mapping the / Where it states:  'We just redirect the URL / to /e/www/. While is seems trivial it is actually trivial with  mod_rewrite, only. Because the typical old mechanisms of URL Aliases (as provides by  mod_alias and friends) only used prefix matching. With this you cannot do such a  redirection because the DocumentRoot is a prefix of all URLs.'    Actually, I did try this time ago. Redirecting / did segfault the httpd process, but  RedirectMatch ^/$ did work perfectly.    Just my 2cents. :P	First of all, you're using a very old version of Apache, please try again with 1.3.28. Secondly we need more information, especially the exact configuration you used to provoke the segfault. I think he's just complaining about an innaccuracy in the rewriteguide. It was written before the RedirectMatch directive existed, so it thinks there is no other way to redirect a single URL-path like '/'. Just as Joshua Slive has stated, I was 'complaining' about an inaccuracy in the  documentation (this is the reason for me putting it in the documentation component  :P).    The version that did segfault was definitively prior to 1.3.28. Cannot send the  config-files, as I found it on a bank I worked for. I remember using the version 1.3.19  (and maybe later the 1.3.21-22). I didn't give it any importance because I thought  aliasing the / was a silly thing I shoudn't have attempted to do :P.  While redirecting / does indeed cause a loop, I can't get it to segfault. The rewrite guide, although in need of some work, on this point pretty clearly says 'don't do that', so doesn't seem inaccurate to me. In the absence of further data, I'm inclined to close this as part of my effort to clear away old and obsolete bug reports.  Thanks. Just as Joshua Slive pointed and confirmed, the bug report had nothing to do   with the segfaults. It was about an inacurate statement in a documentation   page (that, by the way, has not been corrected).      Anyway, I'll just add some comments on the segfault thing.       I remember Apache segfaulted on those Solaris (may be version 7) servers in   two cases:   - Redirecting the / (as I stated, a silly thing to do).   - An old/unused child being killed by the master process. The child died from   segfault instead of sigterm.      Those segfaults may certainly be caused by some factors external to Apache.   The Apache versions used were certainly old even then, because they were the   only ones supported by BEA Weblogic and Vignette. The OS version wasn't the   latest, either. I'm sorry of neither being able to reproduce them, nor to try   it with recent versions of Apache.  Thanks for the additional clarification. I think I understand what you're getting at.

22104	null	CLOSED		Tim Robbins	1059994620000	1073566729000		mod_deflate does not change Content-Length, breaks DAV file upload via PUT Although it is well documented that mod_deflate does not modify the Content- Length header when decoding a gzip-compressed message body, the incorrect value  seems to confuse mod_dav -- when I try to upload a compressed message body with  the PUT method, mod_dav returns a 400 Bad Request error, and this message  appears in the log:  [Mon Aug 04 19:49:25 2003] [error] [client 192.168.0.144] An error occurred  while reading the request body.  [400, #0]  To test, I'm PUT'ing the output of 'echo test | gzip -9c'. What happens is that  dav_method_put()'s first call to ap_get_client_block() returns 5 (strlen ('test/n')), but then it calls ap_get_client_block() again, and it returns -1  to signal an error. I believe this is because it's expecting more data.  I'm not sure how to solve this problem. It's probably not a great idea to  buffer the whole body in memory then fix up the Content-Length header after  decompressing it all, so perhaps mod_deflate could fake up a 'chunked'-encoded  body, putting each block of data returned from zlib into a new chunk, and  signalling EOF with a 0-length chunk. I'm not familiar with the internals of  the Apache httpd, so I'm not sure.  I'm filing this as 'Enhancement' because although the problem is documented, it  would be really nice to be able to use PUT requests w/ gzip-compressed bodies.	mod_dav should use bucket brigades when reading PUT data, then all should be fine.  So changing component to mod_dav and accept this as a bug.  Thanks for the report. Created an attachment (id=7641) Patch to make mod_dav use bucket brigades when handling PUT requests  Thanks for the suggestion to use bucket brigades -- I've got compressed uploads  at least partly working now, but it seems to choke on large requests: [Mon Aug 04 23:21:13 2003] [error] [client 192.168.0.144] (55)No buffer space  available: Could not get brigade.

BTW,     RewriteRule ^/something/from/?$ /index.php [L] will call /www/htdocs/index.php which is fine.   Hope it was clear :-).   Thank you, Andrea Rossignoli	Not a bug. It's by intention.

22805	null	CLOSED		Radu Greab	1062101340000	1066588832000		file descriptors are erroneously closed In the message available at the mentioned URL, I describe a bug in Apache that sometimes blocks Bricolage, a mod_perl application.  The bug is caused by the recent work of adding proactive close functions to prevent file descriptors leaking to the child processes. Basically, in http_main.c, some calls of ap_note_cleanups_for_fd() were replaced with calls to ap_note_cleanups_for_socket_ex(), but ap_bclose() still calls ap_pclosef() which disarms the cleanup for files, not for sockets. Later, the cleanup for socket is invoked because it was not disabled and closes for the second time a file descriptor which may be already closed (no harm) or may be in use by someone else (the Bricolage problem).  I'm proposing a patch that: - in buff.c: modifies ap_bclose() so that on all platforms ap_pclosesocket() is called for sockets and ap_closef() is called for files; - in http_main.c:   - disarms a cleanup before ap_slack() because ap_slack() closes the socket      itself   - changes the level to critical for the error message issued when the fd_sets      test fails   - removes a kill_cleanup before ap_bclose() because it is redundant	Created an attachment (id=7989) proposed patch  FWIW, Radu wrote up a really good analysis of the problem here:    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modperl-dev&m=106200188613283&w=2 Fixed in 1.3.29 (ap_bclose changes only)			David Wheeler	Jim Jagielski	Radu Greab
23130	null	CLOSED		Bjorn Stabell	1063359660000	1063396671000		mod_cache does not cache content with valid Expires header [ Also reported for Apache 1.3.28 as BUG# 23129 ]  This bug was first reported by James Cooper in 1999  (http://archive.apache.org/gnats/4089), but was somehow never included.  Searching the web it is obvious that many people have found this bug through  the years, but none (except James) have reported it.  Instead, it's  become 'common knowledge' that for mod_proxy in Apache to cache content, it has  to have a Last-Modified header.  Just having an Expires header is not enough;  it will always result in a X-Cache: MISS  Last-Modified headers do not really make sense for dynamic content, so many  HTTP Accelerator plugins for dynamic websites only generate Expires headers,  assuming that it'll work fine, when it doesn't.

23287	null	RESOLVED		John N Armstrong	1064028960000	1186464125000		mod_deflate does not properly format decompressed request content mod_deflate is configured to decompress an inbound HTTP SOAP request (note: The Apache SOAP TCPTunnel/Monitor was used to capture the flows between the Apache proxy server and WebLogic):  POST /some/url HTTP/1.0 Host: localhost:1080 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 4727 SOAPAction: 'http://some.soap.action' Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Content-Encoding: gzip <SNIP: Compressed SOAP message/>  The HTTP request body (the SOAP request) is compressed in the gzip format.  mod_deflate does intercept and decompress the content.  Apache is also configured (using mod_proxy) to forward the request on to WebLogic. The request forwarded to WebLogic is as follows:  POST /some/url HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:7101 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 4727 <== Note! SOAPAction: 'http://some.soap.action' Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Content-Encoding: gzip <== Note! <SNIP: Decompressed SOAP message />  mod_deflate should mdoify (or remove) the Content-Encoding header to reflect the fact that the content is NOT compressed, and should re-write the Content-Length header to reflect the actual length of the decompressed content.	Iit cannot change the content-length header, because the data is streamed. Hmm, I guess it's not really intended to decompress as a proxy. Can you try what happens, if you use mod_header's "RequestHeader unset' directive to remove the headers in question?  I think, mod_proxy should be changed, that if the content-length header is removed, it switches to chunked encoding.... duh, that is only possible with HTTP/1.1. Seems there's no simple solution to that problem.  I'm +1 anyway to remove the gzip token from Content-encoding.  Any other ideas? Yes, I think that mod_deflate is rarely used for decompression of the REQUEST -- it's almost always used for compression of the RESPONSE. And, the combination of mod_deflate and proxying the request to a back-end server appears to be problematic.  I tried using mod_headers and the RequestHeader unset command to remove the Content-Encoding: gzip and Content-Length: xxxx headers. The problem with this is that it causes mod_deflate to be be nop-op'ed because he doesn't recognize that the incoming request is compressed without the header.  I considered writing a filter to post-process mod_deflate's output and remove the headers, but that won't work either, because the output is being streamed (as you point out), and the headers will already have been written. Hmmm, ...  Can you not use (the mirror of) the workaround I used to recommend for mod_proxy_html before updating mod_deflate to support decompression of response data from a proxy?  Header unset Accept-Encoding  to tell the Client you don't want gzipped data?  I might actually fix this properly, but no promises. A related problem with servlet requests forwarded to Tomcat via mod_jk: request content gets decompressed, but I get an end of stream at (the original) Content-Length bytes from stream start, resulting in truncated decompressed content for the servlet.  I do not insist on removing 'gzip' from Content-Encoding or removing Content-Length. It's completely OK with me to just ignore Content-Length in my servlet and rely on the servlet request end of stream. Servlets have to be able to handle chunked requests anyway, so using Content-Length is not good style regardless of compression. It's also OK with me to ignore 'gzip' in Content-Encoding, as long as I know that Apache handles it for me. But it's not OK to get truncated content, I obviously do need full decompressed content in the servlet. (In reply to comment #4) > A related problem with servlet requests forwarded to Tomcat via mod_jk: request  I'm certain, this should be fixed in mod_jk. Could you open a bug report / feature  request at mod_jk's tracker? Opened http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34526 William Barker from mod_jk marked 34526 'resolved, wontfix' and insists it's a mod_deflate problem. Would it be possible to have a direct discussion among the developers responsible for this functionality in mod_deflate and mod_jk? It's important to get it fixed, wherever the fixes may happen to be... Fixed in /trunk/ and proposed for backport http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=560689  This kind of thing needs round tuits.  But it's still been an inexcusably long time for a real bug.

23421	null	RESOLVED		Martin D??rst	1064520960000	1102749616000		Remove AddDefaultCharset from httpd.conf as shipped Apache 2.0 currently ships with 'AddDefaultCharset iso-8859-1' in httpd.conf. This should be fixed (by commenting out or removing it, or replacing it with AddDefaultCharset Off) and the comment in httpd.conf should be corrected, for the following reasons:  1) Charset information is important, but no charset information is much    preferable to wrong charset information (contrary to what the comment    in httpd.conf says).  2) Many document formats have their own internal way to specify character    encoding. It is often sufficient to rely on these. It is often easier,    for document authors and administrators, to make sure these are correct,    than to make sure that the served headers are correct.  3) In most parts of the world, including Europe and the Americas (because of    windows-1252), there is rarely any server that contains only iso-8859-1    documents, and there is rarely any server administrator who knows the    encodings of all the served documents (if s/he is even aware of character    encoding issues).  4) Upgraders from Apache 1.3 to Apache 2.0 often overlook this setting,    resulting in large numbers of files served wrongly with charset=iso-8859-1,    and an increasing number of complaints to ISPs and Web hosters. Fixing    this bug would make upgrading easier and more predictible, and would    reduce complaints to hosters that they have difficulties to address    because they are not familiar with character encoding issues.  5) In order to override the setting (and assuming users know how to do    this), users have to have FileInfo permissions for their .htaccess files.    httpd.conf as shipped contains an example of settings for UserDir    directories and similar cases where the users are allowed some    amount of configuration, but this is commented out. So the chance    is high users don't have a chance to fix the problem, even if they    know the correct encoding of their document and the correct way to    set the HTTP header.  6) The oft-cited default of iso-8859-1 for HTTP is something that exists    on only paper, but not at all in practice. If it were observed in    practice, 'AddCharsetDefault iso-8859-1' would be unnecessary.    Because the default is not observed, this setting is harmful.  7) The comment in httpd.conf claims that this setting is a good start for    internationalization. This ignores the fact that many hosts already    contain a lot of internationalized documents.  In connection with this, the documentation for AddDefaultCharset should be updated to clearly point out the potential dangers of using it (i.e. only use this if you know the character encoding of the majority of the documents on your server, and you know what the exceptions are and make sure they are set correctly).	see also bug 14513 http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14513 The new default value causes corruption for people upgrading to the new  version. The mislabeling of Windows-1252 as iso8859-1 can cause the euro symbol  to be incorrect and result in erroneous financial transactions. The misleading Apache documentation and the change to apply the default charset  causes subtle differences which have significant impact. It can also cause non- subtle differences. The fact that web standard calls for http charset to  override the charset in the page, means that change will override even pages  with self-documenting charset (ie pages that use the meta tag). The old  behavior should be restored right away. I'm not enough of an expert in this area to make a decision about it, but the problem with simply removing this directive is that it creates problems with cross-site scripting.  See: http://httpd.apache.org/info/css-security/ and links from that page.  In fact, AddDefaultCharset was originally added to deal with these problems, so simply removing it without addressing the CSS issue would not be smart.  (See also bug 13986 that states that apache shouldn't set a default content-type by default. This issue should probably be addressed along side that one.) OK, I think we need a clarification. We are not requesting the command AddDefaultCharset be eliminated.  We are requesting that its use in the default configuration to set the charset to iso 8859-1 be eliminated.  As for the security risk, the significant piece of the referenced document seems to be: 'In addition, web pages should explicitly set a character set to an appropriate value in all dynamically generated pages. '  We can all agree with this. The problem is iso 8859-1 is not an appropriate value for the majority of configurations. The article references that this used to be the default for some of the web standards and is no longer the case.  It is because it is not the best choice in the majority of cases, even in English speaking markets these days, that it is no longer the default. Perhaps a better compromise solution is to at least ask the administrator what the value should be during the installation and  provide a list of the most common encodings for them to choose from. Or default to UTF-8 and let people know clearly that is what you use.  SuSE 9.0 shipped Apache 2.0 with AddDefaultCharset utf8  As a result any other encoding mentioned in the hmtl/xhtml/xml-source sent to the server was ignored.  That does not fit the behaviour of Apache talked about on the cross-site-scripting page; there it is told that option AddDefaultCharset is only activated if any page-specific encoding is missing.   A mistake in logic, of the behaviour of option AddDefaultCharset ? Apache has absolutely no interest in <meta> tags inside the html.  That comment is talking about AddCharset and similar methods of setting the HTTP headers. To Joshua Slive: Then the faulty behaviour is on the browser's side, insomuch a request is sent without an complete or appropriate header, i.e. including the encoding information. That was my first guess, at Mozilla.  Of course it's presumed that option AddDefaultCharset only is activated if no encoding information is available.Or, to extend the view, if no valid/accepted encoding is sent in the request, given a list of encodings accepted by the server.  Would that still help the CSS-problem?  Dietmar, I can't decipher what you are trying to say.  But this is not the best place to discuss it.  Please try the users@httpd or dev@httpd mailing list. Is this issue still not resolved?  I am Chinese and I am strongly on the side of the reporter.  The problem, I suppose, arises from a problematic standard.  AFAIK, the header sent from the server overrides that contained in a meta tag.  Browsers I use all conform to this behaviour, and sorrows of non-Western Web developers grow.  For Chinese, we routinely use  <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=gb2312'>  to mark a page as Chinese.  And this method allows us to place an ISO-8859-1 page on the same server/directory without worrying about server configurations.  I even do not know now how to achieve this effect if 'AddDefaultCharset' is ever used.  Security is important, but I do not think setting the default charset by the SERVER is the right way to go.  Indeed, I think the suggestion to use a default charset has caused more problems than solved (see stories below).  It is the server-side SCRIPT that should take care of this.  And I do not think the comment in the conf file is correct: it really does harm, because setting it will PREVENT Web developer from specifying the charset in their pages, who should really be responsible for such issues.  By the way, some stories.  Several times I have been called by colleagues because they cannot make Apache display Chinese characters correctly on a newly installed box.  I once translated the mission page for webstandards.org, and after a site migration it no longer displayed Chinese.  After several emails the non-Western pages are moved to a special server or directory and it was OK.  Now the page is archived at   http://archive.webstandards.org/mission_gb2312.html  And it is wrong AGAIN, along with other translations like Japanese!  What is the use of security, if it makes things inaccessible?  (Not to mention that it is a wrong response for a security issue.  Even the page http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_mitigation.html#3 mentions only the use of a meta tag like the gb2312 example above.)  To Dietmar:  Your opinions about Accept-Charset are correct only if  1) A Chinese user can set his browser to accept only GB2312; 2) A Chinese user never need to view ISO-8859-1 pages, or the browser supports per-page configuration of Accept-Charset; and 3) If 'Accept-Charset: gb2312' is sent to the server, the server will not send the default 'charset=ISO-8859-1'.  I do not see any of them holds. I agree that shipping with an AddDefaultCharset preset is unsatisfactory, and screws up users of servers with unresponsive admins.  Can we simply remove it from the default config to deal with the case of authors having more clue than their sysops?  I'd be happy with that, but I'm going to ask for review in other fora where folks have relevant expertise.  Actually the solution is already available to users.  There's a bunch of AddCharset directives in the default httpd.conf that serve precisely this purpose: AddCharset ISO-8859-1  .iso8859-1  .latin1 AddCharset ISO-8859-2  .iso8859-2  .latin2 .cen AddCharset ISO-8859-3  .iso8859-3  .latin3 etc.  So a fix would be to correct errors and omissions in that list, and leave it to authors to control their charset using a suffix on the document name. Of course that's ugly, but at least it works.  Also worth noting: mod_proxy_html 2.x will parse META elements in HTML and XHTML documents and convert them to real HTTP headers. See http://apache.webthing.com/mod_proxy_html/  I just wrote:  > So a fix would be to correct errors and omissions in that list, and leave it > to authors to control their charset using a suffix on the document name. > Of course that's ugly, but at least it works.  Hmmm, I neglected to add that the ugliness goes away if that's used with  mod_negotiation: perhaps we shold ship with multivies on by default? The other crucial issue is of course to document it! *** Bug 30860 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** In addition to the principal reasons given earlier there is also a pragmatic reason not to use AddDefaultCharset in the default httpd.conf. Sending the charset declaration triggers an obscure bug in MSIE with multipart forms, as documented at http://www.interactivetools.com/forum/gforum.cgi?post=34345;sb=post_latest_reply;so=ASC;forum_view=forum_view_collapsed (at the bottom).  I know that Microsoft should fix their browser but I spend a lot of time today debugging an old script that didn't work after upgrading to Apache 2 because of this. I think the right thing is not to trigger bugs in a product that is still used by so many users by shipping a httpd.conf that contains this as a default. I'm surprised that this bug is still around. The only justification for that that I was able to find in the record is the pointer to the Client Side Scripting (CSS) issue. However, this is based on a shallow understanding of CSS. In order to avoid CSS, just setting whatever character encoding is not good enough. A solution requires that the client side gets the right character encoding. Of course, declaring iso-8859-1 as a default doesn't work for a huge amount of Web pages. So this default should be removed as quickly as possible, and the documentation for CSS should be updated to make more clear that it's not 'declare an encoding' but 'declare the right encoding' that is important (also for other reasons than just security).  I can easily provide more information (e.g. a page that shows how use of the wrong encoding, such as declaring a page as iso-8859-1 that isn't iso-8859-1 can lead to attacks) if contacted directly. This was supposed to be fixed a long time ago.  It was for 1.3. I am verifying with the group and will remove it from the default config if there are no objections. Fixed in HEAD (2.1.x), may be backported later to 2.0.x.  svn rev 111582 *** Bug 33028 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Dietmar Temme	Joe Orton	Joshua Slive	Martin D??rst	Nick Kew	Roy T.

Both 2.0 and 1.3 documentation has the same problem.  The example is for:  Load Balancing Description:     Suppose we want to load balance the traffic to www.foo.com over www[0-5].foo.com (a total of 6 servers). How can this be done?  The solution goes on to list multiple cnames for the same label: www    IN  CNAME   www0.foo.com.        IN  CNAME   www1.foo.com.        IN  CNAME   www2.foo.com.

This is incorrect, according to RFC 2181 (and other DNS RFCs): 'There may be only one such canonical name for any one alias.' BIND 8 (and prior versions) could be made to work with multiple cnames, but BIND 9 no longer supports it at all.  The correct implementation uses multiple A records for the label, like so: www   IN  A       1.2.3.1       IN  A       1.2.3.2       IN  A       1.2.3.3       IN  A       1.2.3.4       IN  A       1.2.3.5       IN  A       1.2.3.6	I'm going through the bug db to make sure patches are findable.

This is on SGI IRIX 6.5.20m compiled with the following flags and the SGI MIPsPro compiler:  ./configure --enable-ssl=static --enable-deflate --enable-mods-shared=most --with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl --with-devrandom --with-mpm=worker  Here's the relevant output from mod_status when compiled without --with-mpm=worker:  Total accesses: 41 - Total Traffic: 1.9 MB CPU Usage: u6 s.26 cu0 cs0 - 29.8% CPU load 1.95 requests/sec - 94.1 kB/second - 48.2 kB/request 1 requests currently being processed, 7 idle workers  And with it:  Total accesses: 41 - Total Traffic: 1.9 MB CPU Usage: u67.21 s3.64 cu0 cs0 - 221% CPU load 1.28 requests/sec - 61.8 kB/second - 48.2 kB/request 1 requests currently being processed, 49 idle workers  With a bit of stress testing with multiple clients, I can get the CPU load reported to be on the order of 2-4000%, the machine only has 2 CPUs.  The requests on each run was generated from a fresh start over SSL and using the requests.  mod_jk 1.2.5 is also loaded into the server.	The problem is apparently that each thread is using times() syscall to retrieve info on CPU usage for entire process, and mod_status is joyfully adding up all the values :)  What we really need is to pick the times() info that was retrieved most recently by some thread in the process.  I'll attach a patch in a sec that seems to resolve the problem for me.  It would be helpful if you could try it out.  Note that in the extended status table the same CPU seconds will be reported for each thread.  I haven't done anything about that.  Perhaps '=' or some other symbol should be printed for threads other than the first one.  Created an attachment (id=8758) proposed patch for bogus CPU% with threaded MPM  I tried out the patch, it does appear to generate correct overall CPU usage statistics.  Interestingly, I don't get the same CPU times for each thread in a worker as you suggested, it looks like each thread reports the CPU usage at the time of the last request for the worker thread group.  I agree that it would be a good idea to only display the CPU time once for each thread group, it would be less confusing. >Interestingly, I don't get the same CPU times for each thread in a worker as you >suggested, it looks like each thread reports the CPU usage at the time of the >last request for the worker thread group.  Yeah, I realized later that was an erroneous claim, caused by a lack of common sense and not enough data points :)  I need to do a little more testing, such as create a looper module and see if CPU% is still sane, then commit to 2.1 and request merge to stable.  fixed in 2.1-dev; I'll propose it for merging to 2.0.x once folks have had a chance to compla^H^H^H^H^H^Hlook over it  btw, more code was needed to keep working on linuxthreads (old Linux pthreads implementation); also, I chose to keep displaying CPU time per thread in extended status table...  it provides additional hints with normal thread libraries and it is unique information with linuxthreads  fix committed to stable branch for 2.0.next 			David Rees	Jeff Trawick

Use 'Allow from 204.107.90.128/32', can.  Why does it seem like if the IP is in a network local we have to put /32 on it, and if its remote it works ok?	I'm very skeptical you've identified a bug here for several reasons:  1. I've never heard of any problem remotely like this before, and these features are used frequently.  2. The fact that you are using <Limit GET POST> shows that you are not following recommended practices for apache configuration, and therefore there could be many other things wrong with your config.  I suggest you start with an absolutely default install of apache with no extra modules and no config modifications except the ones you suggest below.  If it still doesn't work, you can reopen this bug, but be sure to provide more details about what is in your logs, the exact OS version, etc.  Thanks for using Apache! Hi,  Ok, we did some investigation.   1) Download/uncompress/untar source 2) Compile with gcc 3.2.3 with just ./configure;make;make install 3) Create a directory under htdocs called testing, put in an .htaccess of :  AuthDBMUserFile /local/wwwcust/passes/sample AuthDBMGroupFile /dev/null AuthName Members_Only AuthType Basic  Satisfy Any  order deny,allow  deny from all  allow from 24.193.48.116  allow from 202.139.152  allow from 210.80.149  allow from 216.183.31.224/27  allow from 209.88.233.224/27  allow from 209.88.69.192/27  allow from 209.135.126  allow from 64.8.218  allow from 63.201.23  allow from 217.145.67.0/25  allow from 62.39.85  allow from 216.231.111.14 require valid-user  4) Edit the stock httpd.conf where it depicts the default document root like <Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs> and change the 'AllowOverride None' to 'AllowOverride All'. Start server 5) From 216.231.111.14 attempt to access the directory, it will ask for an id/pass 6) Change it to 216.231.111.14/32, it works.  Delete all directories and configs.   Start the instructions again, except in step 2 , change it to 'CC=gcc -m32' infront of the ./configure;make;make install At step 5, it will let you in immediately.   So, it seems, in 64 bit mode it has issues, but not 32 bit.  We can reproduce this on mutiple machine that we own, and others own. Interesting.  I assume that it doesn't matter if you remove the Auth*/Require/Satisfy directives and just test mod_access?  I don't have a solaris system handy to test on, but if someone does, I'm sure they'd be interested in your exact OS/patch level. With only the following in .htaccess:   order deny,allow deny from all allow from 216.231.113.11 allow from 24.193.48.116   I see the same symptoms, coming from the 24.* address I get in (Outside our network) , from 216.* (local subnet) I get forbidden, if I add the /32 it works fine.

This is the prefered application packaging format for all Mac OS X application distributions. Presently Apache defaults to serving these files with the mime type text/plain, which causes browsers to display these binary files in the browser window instead of prompting to save to disk. Server administrators that need to serve these files have to manualy add dmg to their configurations, and those whose sites are hosted by third parties have all the hassle of trying to change the config of a server they don't control (though I appreciate an AddType directive in .htaccess is a partial solution).  This issue annoys millions of Mac users, it would be great to see dmg added to the default Apache setup.  Should I open a seperate bug against httpd 2.0 or is this enough to get the issue looked at for both?

23956	null	CLOSED		Eric Seidel	1066682880000	1069794811000		mod_ssl should report actual OpenSSL version mod_ssl (both 1.3.x and 2.x) currently uses the SSL_LIBRARY_TEXT define instead of the  SSLeay_version() function to determine the version number of OpenSSL which it is using.  This is bad because here the mod_ssl binary is carrying the OpenSSL version number instead of  querying the version of OpenSSL it's using.  This can lead to confusion (especailly security related), if  for example an administrator patches OpenSSL to be 3.4.d instead of 3.4.a, to work around known  mod_ssl related vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.  Even though the system has been properly patched, it will still report the old (mod_ssl compiled in)  version number to Scanning software etc.  Our customers complained, and we have fixed the following in our version of Apache... however I feel  this change would make sense up-stream as well.

23998	null	CLOSED		Marco Muishout	1066821300000	1070077418000		mod_proxy truncates status line header causing warning in log files Situation: Client requests JSP page to local apache server (2.0.47). Local apache server  forwards mod_proxy) this request to a central apache server (2.0.47) which is  connected by mod_jk2 (2.0.2) to tomcat 4.1.24. When the local apache server receives its response, the request-response status  line is malformed and a warning is generated in the apache error log file.   The JSP application works fine, but our log files are clogged with these  warnings as every JSP request generates one. We are talking about a major  enterprise-wide global system.  Examining this problem showed that the error is caused by the fact that  mod_proxy is cleaning up/ignoring the trailing space in the status  line:'HTTP/1.1 200 '. It only seems to see or evaluate 'HTTP/1.1 200'.   I read that mod_jk omits the reponse-phrase ('OK' in this case) but this should  (according to standards) not be a problem when at least a trailing space is  added. By tracing the connactions I can see the 'space' in the response status  line before it enters apache.  Either mod_proxy filters out the space or the incoming status line is  incorrectly evaluated.  The error message is generated in  httpd-2.0.47/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c   line 761  For more information, please check  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.mod-proxy/561	Thanks for the report.  Yes, ap_rgetline is stripping any trailing spaces.  The proxy should just fix it and not be so noisy - I'll attach a patch. Created an attachment (id=8666) fix for trailing space handling  I tested the fix that was supplied and everything works OK. I attached two  error log files - one showing the warning, and one which shows the warning is  gone.  Both error log files were recorded while requesting the default application jsp  in out environment, with the apache mod_proxy instance running in debug mode. Created an attachment (id=8690) Apache error log file, including 'warning' bug  Created an attachment (id=8691) Apache error log file, bug fixed using supplied patch (no more warning)  fyi... fix already in 2.1-dev, recently approved for merge into stable branch for 2.0.next  As Jeff already noted, this is fixed.

Are  you sure this will work, especially on days when DST is switched on or off? I don't have the  opportunity to test this right now, but it's obviously important that the behavior is right on these  days.  Anyway, the following is obviously wrong in your version of the patch:  +            if (strcmp(argv[3], 'loc') == 0) { +                use_local = 0;  should be  +            if (strcmp(argv[3], 'loc') == 0) { +                use_local = 1;  or is there something I just didn't get? Yes, you got the obvious typo.  I did fix this, but I didn't upload the right version (and didn't catch it right away).  I also updated the documentation in my patch to note that it does not affect the log rotation time math (i.e. if you say '86400', it will still be rotated at 00:00:00 UTC); it just affects the time formatting done with strftime(3) to use the local time zone.  What I do is set my log rotation time to be 3600, and then use a filename like 'access_log.%Y-%m-%d' (so it re-determines the filename every hour, but it only changes at 00:00:00 local time).  I did it this way because the patch is much simpler (more likely to be acceptable), but I see how this could just make things more confusing, as it changes the behavior of the option.  Sorry about that.  Chris wrote: > I also updated the documentation in my patch to note that it does not affect > the log rotation time math (i.e. if you say '86400', it will still be rotated at > 00:00:00 UTC);  But that's exactly the behavior I wanted to avoid because it makes syncing with cron jobs so  difficult.  > What I do is set my log rotation time to be 3600, and then > use a filename like 'access_log.%Y-%m-%d' (so it re-determines the filename > every hour, but it only changes at 00:00:00 local time).  Which is kind of confusing. If you plan to rotate once a day, 86400 should work for you, even if you  use the 'local' option.  > I did it this way because the patch is much simpler (more likely to be > acceptable)  Well, my patch isn't *that* complicated, is it? And it does exactly what it should, in an intuitive way.  I think the foremost consideration should be what is simple for the *user*.  Ken Coar recently committed an equivalent feature to 2.1-dev, which I presume will be backported to stable branch for a future 2.0.x release.  Please have a look:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/support/rotatelogs.c?r1=1.32&r2=1.34  > Ken Coar recently committed an equivalent feature to 2.1-dev, which I presume > will be backported to stable branch for a future 2.0.x release.  Please have a look:  Ken's patch won't work correctly on the days when DST is switched on or off, because he puts the  test for the local time offset (utc_offset = lt.tm_gmtoff;) outside of the 'for (;;)' loop. Therefore, the  time offset will only be set once after the start of the rotatelogs process, and will not be updated  after a switch of DST occurs.  Ken himself writes in his comment: 'NB: Using -l in an environment which changes the GMT offset  (such as for BST or DST) can lead to unpredictable results!', suggesting he has indeed not tested his  patch on days when the switch occurs. However, unless you intend to use DST there's no point at all  in using local time instead of a fixed offset from GMT.  <Sigh> Why don't you just use the patch I committed? It's thoroughly tested, especially on days  when the DST switch occurs, and proven to work in a production environment for almost two years  now. I don't know why the patch here wasn't used.  When Ken's patch was posted to the developer's mailing list I pointed out this patch/PR.  Regardless, I pointed out your recent comments here to Ken and he integrated your comment.  See   http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/support/rotatelogs.c  (I'm just the middleman here ;) )  Jeff, thanks! As far as I can see, the new code by Ken should work. Therefore I close this report. :-) Thanks for your review, and I'm sorry about the confused path to a solution for this issue! 			Chris Adams	Jeff Trawick	Uli Zappe
24437	null	RESOLVED		Jess Holle	1068051480000	1106347720000		mod_auth_ldap doubly-escapes backslash (/) characters in uids In order to authenticate against ActiveDirectory-style uids with backslashes in  them the authentication user name contains this character.  Unfortunately the LDAP logs are showing that Apache is over-escaping the  backslash -- at least on Windows (2000 SP4, all security updates applied).  I  suspect this above the LDAP SDK layer and thus applies to all platforms, but I  could be proven wrong, of course.  This is a serious issue to anyone needing to support use of such (existing)  directories.  Both workarounds and pointers to code areas to investigate (other  than 'look at the mod_auth_ldap and/or util_ldap sources' -- I know that much)  would be greatly appreciated!	It turns out that the Microsoft LDAP SDK escapes these characters on its own!  I found the filter escape code in mod_auth_ldap_build_filter in mod_auth_ldap.c and observed that its input and output was exactly what I'd expect.  I also note that it's output is what is passed to the LDAP SDK.  I commented out the escape code (in the simplest fashion, i.e. yes, I could use strncpy at this point) and then (and only then) am able to authenticate with /, ), (, and * in my user name.  I assume this is a Microsoft LDAP SDK feature as my other LDAP SDK experience suggests the escaping done by mod_auth_ldap is required.  All the same, I believe we should #if out this filter code when using the Microsoft LDAP SDK -- as it only currently serves to prevent that which it is intended to allow.  My change is to add the comments in the code excerpt below taken from mod_auth_ldap.c (sorry, I'm not creating a patch as strncpy would be better, etc, etc):      filtbuf_end = filtbuf + FILTER_LENGTH - 1;     for (p = user, q=filtbuf + strlen(filtbuf);          *p && q < filtbuf_end; *q++ = *p++) { /* Microsoft LDAP SDK does this automatically (!); doing this here causes double-escaping!!!    The following code block must therefore be removed when using Microsoft's LDAP SDK. */ /*         if (strchr('*()//', *p) != NULL) {             *q++ = '//';             if (q >= filtbuf_end) { \t        break; \t    }         } */     }     I believe your patch is correct, however we need to use a #ifdef to make   this determination, to prevent clashes with folks building under OpenLDAP   or the Netscape LDAP sdk.  Yes, that's a big reason why I did not provide a patch -- I had not taken the time to investigate the proper #ifdef's, etc, to use. Patch committed to v2.1.0-dev  Please test if this solves this problem.  Doh!  I'm sure that will work as it is identical to my fix apart from a proper #if block.  I should have taken the 2 extra minutes when I patched this on my own copy to look in apr_ldap.h and see   #define APR_HAS_MICROSOFT_LDAPSDK   1 on Windows and done a proper #if block around this.  Thanks for rounding out this fix and getting it in.  A merge back to 2.0 would be good too :-) Fixed in v2.0.50-dev.  As the person who provided the patch, I must regretfully re-open this SPR.  The patch works great *except* when the character immediately following the / is a valid hexidecimal character.  I'm not sure how to handle this case with the Microsoft LDAP SDK.  Hopefully we're missing some simple 'behave correctly' flag on the Microsoft LDAP SDK... Created an attachment (id=12919) Patch to address remaining issues (/[0-9,a-f], e.g. /a, etc)  I discovered Microsoft documentation at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/adsi/adsi/search_filter_syntax.asp that essentially states 'RFC 1960 says...', followed by an accurate quote of this IETF RFC, followed by section titled 'Special characters' where they state a completely different means by which they require you to handle all the special characters from the IETF RFC -- without actually stating that they're requiring other syntax than that indicated by the RFC much less why they require this!  I produced a patch wherein the Microsoft documentation is obeyed when using their LDAP SDK.  This seems to fix the remaining issues, so I've attached the patch (see above). Is it possible to create a patch for v2.1 also? The patch does not apply cleanly to mod_authnz_ldap.c, not sure why.  Created an attachment (id=12930) Patch against HEAD rather than against 2.0.52  I've attached a patch against mod_authnz_ldap.c as requested.  Note that I've only tested this on Windows against Microsoft's LDAP at this point (the problematic case).  After pre-processing, there should be no differences in the code for any other platform resulting from my changes. Committed to HEAD, backport proposed to v2.0 The LDAP code in v2.0 is effectively abandoned, as it's too difficult to fix at this point (most of the fixes have involved major rewrites and have gone in httpd v2.1 and apr v1.1).  If this is broken in httpd v2.1, please reopen this bug.  I guess I'll check again in 2.2 whenever it is 'stable'.  I have to support a redistribution of a stable 2.x release, so at this time that would be 2.0.52.  Thus I'll keep applying my patch to 2.0.x.			Graham Leggett	Jess Holle	Will Rowe
24450	null	CLOSED		Chris Knight	1068082200000	1068212790000		GprofDir directive generates random directories (Note that this is with release 2.0.48 which is not listed in the Version box.)  If you define GprofDir in the Apache configuration, directories with random characters are generated.  It turns out that it's a problem with chdir_for_gprof in server/mpm/mpm_prefork/prefork.c where 'buf' is tested/used without initialization. Here's the patch:  202a203 >       *buf = '/0';  Documentation for the GprofDir and profiling in general would be greatly appreciated. I've been unable to get Apache to generate gmon.out, even with the '-pg -DGPROF' CFLAGS.	thanks for the patch! fix for random dirname problem now committed to 2.1-dev  somebody has fixed the missing 2.0.48 choice in the meantime  re instructions for gprof:  My guess is that [almost] nobody has done this since 1.3 days and there may not be skills right now to document it properly...  also, I don't know if there may be limitations of gprof that can break it with Apache 2 on some platforms (e.g., if libpthread is referenced due to thread-capable libapr).  You'll probably need to investigate further to get this resolved, though it would be worth posting a query to dev@httpd to see if anybody has gotten it working recently.  Perhaps see if gprof works with Apache 1.3 on your box first.  If not, then that simpler, better understood case should be resolved first.  At least one small issue is fixed. I'm closing this bug now but feel free to re-open it if you encounter further issues. Thanks for  using Apache.			Erik Abele	Jeff Trawick

Setting CookieName to Apache gets rid of the problem.  If RFC2965 cookies are set, the problem is not the segfault, but rather the fact that cookie simply isn't found. Therefore, every new connection generates yet another cookie (as visible in the log). libapreq2 also sees the cookie as a different one every time. Therefore, the session upkeeping cannot be done at all.  In any event, setting CookieName to Apache does not work around the above problem for RFC2965 cookies. Not sure if the patch does... Bojan Smojver, I recommend you use CookieStyle Netscape or CookieStyle Cookie (or the synonymous CookieStyle 2109) in httpd.conf, not CookieStyle Cookie2 (or the synonymous CookieStyle RFC2965).  I watched HTTP network traffic through Ethereal, and noted that while Apache correctly sends 'Cookie2:' headers, Mozilla does not accept them. This is why you see a new cookie each time in your logs: Apache is not finding the cookie because your browser is not accepting 'Cookie2:' headers.  The following is my second try at a patch. It's more elegant than my first patch. It solves all of the problems (I tested it with or without the CookieName directive, and with CookieStyle set to Apache, Cookie, and Cookie2 -- though Mozilla doesn't yet accept Cookie2 headers, so I couldn't test cookie detection). Like my previous patch, this patch has not yet been assessed by anyone on the Apache developer's list.

I'm waiting for advice on the 2.0.x patch you see below from a developer who's closer to the ASF than I am. Once I get an all clear, I'll submit the fix to the Apache developer's mailing list as a 2.0.x patch as well as a back-ported 1.3.x patch.  -Manni  *** Bug 24384 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** manni: latest patch is looking good so far.  i'll give it a closer look  tomorrow.  sorry i couldn't get it taken care of at apachecon last week... my  notebook's hard drive crashed!  doh!!  =)  fyi, i put a notice on http://httpd.apache.org/ about this problem since lots  of people seem to be hitting it.

24801	null	CLOSED		Jess Holle	1069194960000	1096480360000		Apache crashes when distinct users exceeds LDAPCacheEntries The following *is* true with Apache 2.0.47 on Windows.  It *may* well be true  on other platforms as well -- I've not done sufficient testing to say for  certain.  Apache crashes when the number of distinct users authenticating against LDAP  exceeds the setting used for LDAPCacheEntries.  This does not always occur on  first exceeding this cache size, but in my experience it will invariably occur  after a few occurences of exceeding the cache size.  A little debugging strongly suggests that there is an issue with the code which  removes old entries from the cache in this case.  The workaround is either to use a value of 0 for LDAPCacheEntries, i.e. disable  the cache, or use a value that is larger than your user population plus some  safety factor.  The safety factor is necessary in that it appears to be  possible to have more than one entry for a given user in the cache.  This  appears to occur when one request is using the user entry when another request  for authenticating the same user comes in.  This issue is masked by bug #24800 and cannot be reached until you work around  it.	P.S.  I believe this issue might may still be masked by an undersized shared memory block even though bug #24800 appears to be fixed in 2.0.49.  For instance with:    LDAPCacheEntries 2150   # Next line was necessary last I checked as 0 caused issues with active cache   LDAPOpCacheEntries  1   LDAPSharedCacheSize 865000   LDAPSharedCacheFile logs/mod_ldap_cache  I get a child process crash one I get to somewhere between 2151 and 2155 distinct users.  Finally, I'm pretty sure I verified that this issue exists on Solaris and AIX as well -- but I clearly forgot to note it here. Trying to look at this now, although I'm not that familiar with the cache code. Do you have an example of a stacktrace where the crash is occuring?  I'm trying to work out why the problem would be in cache cleanup rather than in adding to the cache - maybe it's an edge case somewhere in the cleanup?  It's a long-standing bug that the shared memory caching code does not check for the apr_rmm_*alloc functions returning NULL, so it will of course die horribly if the rmm segment fills up and the code tries to allocate more:  return (void *)apr_rmm_addr_get(cache->rmm_addr, apr_rmm_calloc(cache->rmm_addr, size));  That is a separate bug -- which I believe has been fixed in/by 2.0.49 -- at least my test case for it no longer failed there.  This bug is about the case where the physical shared memory bytes are sufficient but the specified logical cache size (i.e. # of entries) is not.  In this case, the cache should simply purge older entries.  Instead it crashes (attempting to do this).  I've been meaning to generate a stack trace, but have not managed yet. Created an attachment (id=11633) Add checking for NULL in *_rmm_* functions  Does this patch make any difference for you?  In util_ald_cache_insert(), it attempts to add an item to the cache. There is no check for whether the cache is full, because it is assumed that on the edge case (of the very last cache entry being allocated) util_ald_cache_purge() will run, which again is assumed to bring down the cache size.  So in this case, it looks like util_ald_cache_purge() is not bringing down the cache size, so on the next entry we overflow.  Try this patch and see if it makes a difference - it checks for overflow before we add, not after. The purge code is probably still broken, but at least we won't segfault. Created an attachment (id=11634) Add sanity check so that we don't overflow if purge fails for any reason  Just committed the above patches to the v2.1.0-dev tree, as they stomp on the segfaults.  The cache problem remains however, if the cache sizes at set to 1, mod_auth_ldap starts returning auth failures.  I applied the patch provided to 2.0.49 sources (the latest I had readily available) and get a crash with the following traceback (on Windows).  Note this was for user 2161 with a cache size of 2150.  Also note that this executable also includes the latest patches for util_ldap.c [for authenticated LDAP server access] and mod_auth_ldap.c [for avoiding double-escaping with Microsoft's LDAP SDK].  util_ldap_dn_compare_node_compare(void * 0x00815b98, void * 0x04d4de80) line 91 + 12 bytes util_ald_cache_fetch(util_ald_cache * 0x00d8008c, void * 0x04d4de80) line 351 + 17 bytes util_ldap_cache_checkuserid(request_rec * 0x6fb51341, util_ldap_connection_t * 0x007dd1e8, const char * 0x0078ced0, const char * 0x007799c8, int 7991832, char * * 0x00000002, const char * 0x00000000, const char * 0x04d4def0, const char * * 0x007dee59, const char * * * 0x04d4dee4) line 766 + 22 bytes mod_auth_ldap_check_user_id(request_rec * 0x6ff10e5f) line 334 ap_run_check_user_id(request_rec * 0x007dd1e8) line 69 + 31 bytes ap_process_request_internal(request_rec * 0x6ff0d6f8) line 193 + 6 bytes ap_process_request(request_rec * 0x007dd1e8) line 245 ap_process_http_connection(conn_rec * 0x6ff0423f) line 250 + 6 bytes ap_run_process_connection(conn_rec * 0x007c8ab8) line 42 + 31 bytes ap_process_connection(conn_rec * 0x007c8ab8, void * 0x007c89e8) line 175 + 6 bytes worker_main(long 2013300156) line 718 MSVCRT! 780085bc() KERNEL32! 7c581af6()  Once I let this process die a new child process is created and the test set (of 2500 users) works fine.  For testing this sort of thing, I recommend just exporting a single user (with password) from LDAP and using this export as a template to programmatically create many users all the same attributes except for the user name.  You can then use a simple program, script, or even Ant to attempt to fetch an authenticated resource on behalf of each user in turn. Patches to fix segfaults in the cache code were applied to v2.1.0-dev and v2.0.50-dev. Testing this by reducing the cache sizes to a size of 1 show that the segfaults are gone, but the mod_auth_ldap module is returning an auth fail when it shouldn't, and the cache gets full and stays full.  I have created a new bug report for this: 29207.   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 29207 *** > Note that the last time I tested the cache entry overflow it still > crashed when I through 2500 unique user login attempts at a 2150 > entry cache.  This is more representative of our real use cases > than 5 unique users against a single user entry cache or the like > and I've not had a chance to (or much interest in) testing this > particular case.  I've built an Apache 2.0.50 from sources for Windows (to get HTTPS support, of course, plus tiny extensions to mod_deflate and sockopt -- which is missing send-buffer-size configurability on Windows) and re-ran the test noted above.  I get a 100% repeatable crash at around user 2160, i.e. the buffer overflow is *not* fixed, at least not on Windows.  [I can test Solaris and AIX when I get those binaries built.]  In short, this bug is *not* fixed in 2.0.50. Created an attachment (id=12817) Fix to util_ald_cache_purge() to relink lists properly  As per the last comment, I have found the problem behind this bug: util_ald_cache_purge() simply never relinked the linked list entries during cache purge.  Instead it freed various elements in the linked list without updating any linked list pointers, thus begging for trouble as the memory is reused, etc...  Also, I know this has been resolved as 'duplicate', but the fix I have found proves that the problem was not limited to 'duplicate'' bug 29207.  I am thus reopening this until someone commits my patch. The final patch for this bug that fixes the util_ald_cache_purge()relink  problem has been backported and posted.  See  dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.0.52. *** Bug 29207 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Brad Nicholes	Graham Leggett	Jess Holle	Joe Orton
24805	null	CLOSED		Herbert G. Fischer	1069197780000	1071354123000		piped log programs respawning again after Apache is stopped Hi,  After digging the internet for something usefull on this problem I solved posting this bug report with all I discovered about this 'bug' (probably).  When Apache starts, it starts all piped log programs 'instances' correctly, but, when I stop Apache, all piped log programs instances remain running 'sleepy' (not zombie). Starting Apache again, it forks another set of instances of these piped log programs leaving a lot of them running on the system.  Initialy I tested with rotatelogs and cronologs, but also this problem can happen with any piped program, dealing or not with the logs (even a simple grep as piped log program).  I started debugging Apache by attaching strace to the main root Apache process and stoping Apache to see the error messages. I discovered that Apache logs on error_log these messages:  piped log program '/usr/local/sbin/cronolog /usr/local/sites/default/logs/access.%Y-%m-%d.log' failed unexpectedly piped log program '/usr/local/sbin/cronolog /usr/local/sites/portal/logs/access.%Y-%m-%d.log' failed unexpectedly  The interesting thing is that when I use strace this way and stops Apache, all instances of the piped log programs stops as nothing had happened wrong.  Here are some of the lines strace shows me:  ============================================================================== wait4(-1, 0xbffff900, WNOHANG|WUNTRACED, NULL) = 0 select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {1, 0})     = 0 (Timeout) wait4(-1, 0xbffff900, WNOHANG|WUNTRACED, NULL) = 0 select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {1, 0})     = ?

This program only stops with SIGKILL.  I put it as a piped log program on httpd.conf to test what apache is doing with them.  After running apachectl start, apache runs twice each piped log. I've put two custom logs with piped logs on httpd.conf and apache started 4 piped log instances.  here are the logs after apache starts:  pid 9146 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:51 2003 pid 9146 received signal 15 pid 9147 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:51 2003 pid 9147 received signal 15 pid 9149 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:52 2003 pid 9150 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:52 2003  Apache starts a set of these piped log programs and send SIGTERM to them. After, apache starts them again.  After calling apachectl stop, here are the logs:  pid 9146 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:51 2003 pid 9146 received signal 15 pid 9147 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:51 2003 pid 9147 received signal 15 pid 9149 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:52 2003 pid 9149 received signal 15 pid 9150 started at Thu Nov 20 11:58:52 2003 pid 9150 received signal 15  Apache sent SIGTERM to the last two instances of my piped log programs.  I think that the bug is related to how Apache treats piped log programs crashes.  When calling apachectl stop, apache kills all piped log programs with SIGTERM but the crash-safe code of piped log programs starts all piped log programs again, leaving them running before apache really stops.  Please! I need help here! Nobody is helping! I'm starting to consider not testing Apache 2 anymore if nobody helps me on this problem. I am sorry you are frustrated, and I am very empathetic.  Please note that something is happening with this PR, but it is not at all obvious to the casual observer.  The piped log program respawning issue appears to be related to a mod_cgid daemon respawning issue that has prevented the cgid daemon respawning logic to be merged into stable.  What we're working on is a way for other child logic such as piped log management and cgid daemon management to be able to query whether or not the server is terminating.  That info is needed to avoid re-spawning the child at termination.  See the thread 'ap_get_server_state()' on dev@httpd.  Respawning logic is just one use for ap_get_server_state(), so there probably isn't any explicit text describing the relationship in that thread. another note in case certain developers see this and think I am ignoring their comments :)  replace 'ap_get_server_state()' references in my previous update to this PR with 'new flavor of ap_mpm_query(), or something else that gives the state of the server'  you didn't mention what MPM you're using...  I added some general support to prefork thus far to fix this type of problem, and also changed the piped log support to use this logic...  changes for worker and other MPMs will come later  I'll attach a patch for 2.0.48 and prefork MPM in a moment...  if you're using prefork, please try it out...  the symptoms I get seem to vary from platform to platform (sometimes I can't see any symptom, sometimes Apache tries to start the piped log program but something has been corrupted and prevents it from starting, etc.) Created an attachment (id=9220) keep apache from trying to restart piped loggers at termination  I don't know what MPM is. Can you tell me, so I can tell you what MPM I'm using.  I found that all this problem doesn't happen on a IBM PPC 7046-B50 PowerPC 604r with SuSE 7.3 PPC. If you don't know which MPM, that probably means you're using the default (prefork).  You can display the MPM via 'apachectl -V'.  Here is how prefork looks:  $ /usr/local/apache2047/bin/apachectl -V | grep MPM  -D APACHE_MPM_DIR='server/mpm/prefork'  Here is how worker looks:  $ ph/2.0.47/built/bin/apachectl -V | grep MPM  -D APACHE_MPM_DIR='server/mpm/worker'  Incidentally, I too had a system that had no apparent ill symptom (RedHat 6.1 on a Pentium III 500MHz).  I suspect that many (most?) people aren't noticing any such problem with piped loggers, at least on a regular basis.  Yes... It's prefork. If I can switch this to another thing, what do you recommend ? I pretend to try to see if this problem is solved for now.  here is my apachectl -V output:  Server version: Apache/2.0.48 Server built:   Nov 18 2003 21:28:26 Server's Module Magic Number: 20020903:4 Architecture:   32-bit Server compiled with....  -D APACHE_MPM_DIR='server/mpm/prefork'  -D APR_HAS_SENDFILE  -D APR_HAS_MMAP  -D APR_HAVE_IPV6 (IPv4-mapped addresses enabled)  -D APR_USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZE  -D APR_USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZE  -D SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT  -D APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD  -D AP_HAVE_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS  -D HTTPD_ROOT='/usr/local/httpd-2.0.48'  -D SUEXEC_BIN='/usr/local/httpd-2.0.48/bin/suexec'  -D DEFAULT_PIDLOG='logs/httpd.pid'  -D DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD='logs/apache_runtime_status'  -D DEFAULT_LOCKFILE='logs/accept.lock'  -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG='logs/error_log'  -D AP_TYPES_CONFIG_FILE='conf/mime.types'  -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE='conf/httpd.conf'   This are the hardware configuration of both machines I've experienced problems:  Intel P4 Xeon 2.2 Ghz - 2GB RAM Intel P4 1.6 - 512MB RAM  Both are running optimized kernels for P4.

Both machines are very fast, and both are using Slack 9.1 As Apache 2 have multithread support, can the speed affect Apache ou some system lib for multithread ??  Tks! Also:  I need to use PHP within these servers. So, I going to have problems on changing the MPM to worker or another else ?? I'm not suggesting you switch to worker MPM ;)  I originally didn't know which MPM you were using and wanted to point out that the patch doesn't fix the worker scenario, only the prefork scenario.  Now we know you're using prefork, so keep your configuration, apply the patch, and do make && make install and hopefully this problem will be resolved for you.   I see.  I tested with MPM worker and PHP+ZTS and It worked correctly. No respawning piped log programs.  This setup it stable ?? Can I leave that ? The PHP folks recommend to NOT use PHP with a threaded Apache 2 MPM such as worker, because they offer interfaces to a lot of 3rd party libraries and cannot ensure that such calls are thread-safe.  I don't know how to evaluate whether or not your PHP usage is subject to such problems.  Unless the PHP folks can help you evaluate your situation, I'd recommend using the prefork MPM.  Thanks for you help. I'm getting back to prefork with your patch applied. But I'm not giving up.  If you need anything to help debug this problem, as I have it, please, tell me.  And thanks for the patch! *** Bug 19035 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 19981 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 23109 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Fix committed to 2.1-dev.

When I do a GET and obtain a 200 in the reply there are the cache headers, but when the reply is 304 there is no way have theese headers. So when the browser's cache expires, the expire-date is not updated more. For each page I obtain a 304 for each element for ever...

Thanks Fabio	I found an old issue (http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/96-08-30)... seems to be  an old problem:  <cut....>  Responses can also contain a definite time when the document will expire, in  the Expires HTTP header. There are some cases where the expiry time of a  document might change, even if the document itself has not changed. So a 304  status message can include an updated expires time, which the browser should  use to replace the expires time in it's cached copy of the file. Currently  Apache does not send out the expires header on 304 status, which is required by  HTTP/1.1. The problem with not sending out the expires header is that the  browser still keeps the old expiry time, so it thinks the document has expired  straight away. This will be fixed in the next release.   <cut....>  Is there a work-around?  Thanks, Fabio  I am currently working on this problem. There is not currently a workaround that I know of. I know what the problem is (only certain filters are run in the error path and expires is not one of them). I am currently working on a solution to the problem. Thank you for reporting this and for using Apache. *** Bug 25123 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** The solution lies somewhere within the following:  mod_expires only register with 'ap_register_output_filter'...  and within 'modules/http/http_protocol.c', we do this (flushing the output filter):  AP_DECLARE(void) ap_send_error_response(request_rec *r, int recursive_error) {     int status = r->status;     int idx = ap_index_of_response(status);     char *custom_response;     const char *location = apr_table_get(r->headers_out, 'Location');      /* At this point, we are starting the response over, so we have to reset      * this value.      */     r->eos_sent = 0;      /* and we need to get rid of any RESOURCE filters that might be lurking      * around, thinking they are in the middle of the original request      */      r->output_filters = r->proto_output_filters;  This PR has been fixed in the 2.1-dev branch and has been suggested for backporting to the 2.0 stable branch.

I may be getting some of the subtleties wrong here; please see this mail from Justin Erenkrantz for a better description:  http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=50876  It's part of this thread  http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/BrowseList?list=dev&by=thread&from=135712  ...which starts with Ben Collins-Sussman explaining why Subversion's recent switch to using subrequests for authorization broke digest auth, for users who had previously been using it successfully.  Oh: and later, in a private email exchange, Sander Striker tentatively confirmed Brian Fitzpatrick's outline of a solution:     B. W. Fitzpatrick wrote:    > So basically, mod_auth_digest needs to see if it's in    > a subreq, and if it is, then ignore the URI in the    > Auth header and use the uri from the subreq itself?    >    > Is that a correct understanding?        That sounds about right.        Sander	I think Fitz has it reversed.  mod_auth_digest needs to use the uri of r->main, not of the subreq because the hashed nonce will  be off of the original request's URI.  Right now, I think it's using the subreq's uri (i.e. r->uri), but  that isn't what the user sent.  Hence, it can't compute the 'same' hash. Actually, I think it shouldn't be doing anything other than checking if the subreq uri is in the same directory/location block (or, in the same auth domain), and if so, just copy what was done for the main request. My subversion server already had a modified mod_auth_digest, so I went digging. It looks like the subreq is already using fields of the main request to check the digest, with one exception -- digest_header_rec does not have a method field. When I get these authentication failures, the subreq method doesn't match the main req's method.  I added that field, set it to r->method in parse_hdr_and_update_nc(), and modified old_digest() and new_digest() to use resp->method instead of r->method, and that fixed the problem. Created an attachment (id=9946) The changes described above in patch form (and stripped of other local changes)  Just adding the PatchAvailable keyword...

Here is the section of the httpd.conf file that relates to user dirs:  <IfModule mod_userdir.c>     #     # UserDir is disabled by default since it can confirm the presence     # of a username on the system (depending on home directory     # permissions).     #     #UserDir disable       #     # To enable requests to /~user/ to serve the user's public_html     # directory, remove the 'UserDir disable' line above, and uncomment     # the following line instead:     #     UserDir public_html      ScriptAliasMatch ~([a-z]+)/cgi-bin/(.*) /home/zathras/$1/public_html/cgi-bi$       <Directory ~ '/home/zathras/[a-z0-9]+/public_html/cgi-bin'>        AllowOverride None       Options +ExecCGI       </Directory>           </IfModule>	The ScriptAliasMatch could very well be the problem here.

25520	null	CLOSED		Adam Sussman	1071450600000	1074298674000		Corrupt log lines at high volumes mod_log_config with buffered logging turned on shows corrupted log lines when serving at very high volumes using the worker mpm.  This is very consistent behaviour with all recent versions of 2.0.  The problem appears to be that the per-child buffer management is not thread safe.  There is nothing to prevent the memcpy operations in ap_buffered_log_writer by different threads from overlapping.  Since this is a problem that happens at high volume, adding a mutex around this isn't necessarily the most attractive option.  Also, it is unclear whether or not a thread mutex is good enough.  mod_rewrite uses a global mutex for its logging.	A thread mutex should be good enough for handling the buffer and possibly flushing.  Each process would be atomically appending a set of complete trace records to the file, and that doesn't have to be handled explicitly by mod_log_config.  With buffered logs there will be a much higher incidence of out of order records, but that can happen already.  I wonder if the big picture is that for a threaded MPM config you're better off shoving everything to a piped logger to handle in its simple way rather than adding serious mutex contention to the web server.  Still, the code to make it functionally correct is relatively simple so it should be implemented and the user should get to decide which is more appropriate.  fix just committed to Apache 2.1-dev...  I'll propose it for backport once folks have had a chance to look at it  Thanks for your report, and thanks for using Apache! 			Jeff Trawick

25659	null	RESOLVED		David Blake	1071856020000	1127234577000		Memory leak in ssl_util_algotypeof(). The function ssl_util_algotypeof(X509 *pCert, EVP_PKEY *pKey) allows being  called with the parameter pKey == NULL.  The parameter pKey is allocated with  X509_get_pubkey() which needs a matching call to EVP_PKEY_free(pKey) somewhere.  Since the parameter for pKey was pass in as NULL the calling function doesn't  have a way of freeing it so a conditional check is needed for this case.  The  patch I have provided checks the pKey parameter for NULL and sets a boolean so  that before exiting the function we can conditionally free pKey.	Created an attachment (id=9646) Patch to fix memory leak in ssl_util_algotypeof().  PatchAvailable Thanks for your patch submission!  Aren't BOOL, TRUE, and FALSE Windows-only features?  I believe that this should use int, 1, and 0 for portability.  ugg, ignore last comment :)  I didn't realize until looking at your next patch that mod_ssl defines these odd types when the platform doesn't define it...  This patch does exactly what the OpenSSL applications code does: free the pubkey after use. The check on  the incoming parameter is necessary because the other time this function gets  called, it is fed a key that  is used after the function call.   +1 on this patch.  +1 on this patch too. I committed a slightly modified patch.			David Blake	Jeff Trawick	Martin Kraemer	Sander Temme

Other than for completeness, the reason this is needed is that Cisco has a class of router that identifies user specific routing sessions with signalling that is based on the source port of the TCP/IP connection.  Web based software dealing with these routers has had to use customized HTTP servers (normally based on Jetty).  Having this server variable available in mod_rewrite would allows a standard httpd to be used with these routers.  regards	I think enhancement request 18579 may also be related to this type of Cisco Router. I've added the variable in 2.1 (main development branch) and proposed it for backport into 2.0 and 1.3. Finally included into 2.0 and 1.3, so it will appear in the next releases.

25867	null	CLOSED		Rob Meyer	1073071020000	1073229123000		[patch] SSL random number seeding errors on startup Installing httpd-2.0.48 on solaris, with SSL support (openSSL 0.9.7c) led me to the following error:  [Fri Jan 02 10:18:39 2004] [warn] Init: PRNG still contains insufficient entropy! [Fri Jan 02 10:18:39 2004] [error] Init: Failed to generate temporary 512 bit RSA private key Configuration Failed  The SSLRandomSeed directive was set to builtin though, which according to the docs should always be available. Trying values to point it at my egd socket also had no effect. A truss of the process showed it trying to open /dev/random, /dev/srandom, and /dev/urandom anyway. A pretty exhaustive search turned up lots of people with this problem, but no real definitive answers.  Finally, I figured it out, and I'm guessing the situation is similar for a lot of people. I had just installed the server, without generating any certificates yet, so I was using 'apachectl start' to make sure the server started up without SSL support. This of course doesn't define 'SSL' on the command line, and the entire ssl.conf is wrapped in an <IFdefined SSL>. So therefore, the SSLRandomSeed directive was never getting read, and apache was asking openssl for the default /dev/random.  So 'apachectl start' seems to be broken if the server is compiled with mod_ssl and the platform does not have a /dev/random. The most obvious fix is to move the SSLRandomSeed directives outside of the IFdefine SSL, making them execute regardless of the SSL setting (but still only included if mod_ssl is present). A patch to do just that for ssl-std.conf.in is included.   If this isn't an appropriate solution, or 'apachectl start' is not supported for ssl-enabled installations, then this should be at least mentioned in the docs or FAQ, probably where the mention of this exact error message occurs (in the 'About installation' section), as it seems to be pretty commonly encountered (sometimes with a different root cause, but I'd imagine this one is pretty common judging by the number of identical questions out there on the web with no definitive answer).	Created an attachment (id=9772) Patch for ssl-std.conf.in to make seeding configuration always valid  There is already some mention of this in the FAQ: http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/ssl/ssl_faq.html#entropy  Maybe it is too early for me to read patches, but your patch appears to move the SSLRandomSeed outside <IfDefine SSL> which would generally be a bad thing since the loading of mod_ssl in a dso default config has: <IfDefine SSL> LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so </IfDefine> So you'd run into startup errors whenever starting without -DSSL Whoops. I've got a static mod_ssl, and the only place IFDefine appeared in the default config files was in ssl-std.conf wrapping the whole thing. Didn't realize it was used in shared mod_ssl configurations, and that is definitely going to cause a problem. Looks like this only applies to static mod_ssl compliations, and that a different fix is needed.  I'm not very familiar with the apache codebase, but it would seem that the real fix is to not initialize mod_ssl at all if SSL is not defined at runtime. That would solve the problem and would make the most sense. If you're not asking for ssl to be turned on, then it probably should not get initialized (which then requires the directives that get explicitly excluded when you run the server without -DSSL, leading to this little catch 22). Maybe I'll poke around and see if this possible (probably take me a while though).  As for the FAQ, right now, when someone asks this question, they get told to look at the FAQ, and even if they read and understand this item completely, there is still more to it. Currently in the affected configuration, you can change SSLRandomSeed all you like; it never gets read out of the config file. You either need to move it out of the IFdefine, or recompile the server with a different default random socket.  So the quickest interim solution would just be to tack this on in the FAQ right in the section you mention:  'When mod_ssl is compiled into your httpd statically, you must start it with the -DSSL flag (or use 'apachectl startssl'), otherwise the SSLRandomSeed directive will be ignored, and the compiled-in default will be used.'  I do think that just a plain start command without -DSSL should work to start httpd without SSL support, since starting with SSL support may not always be desireable (or possible if the person starting the server doesn't know the passphrase for the key). Using IfDefine SSL doesn't make sense in the same way  for a static module as it does for the dso version. My suggested fix would be to wrap everyting that is now wrapped in IfDefine SSL in an IfModule instead  (except the LoadModule and possibly the example https vhost). Everything is wrapped in an Ifmodule:  <IfModule mod_ssl.c>     conf/ssl.conf </IfModule>  But that's alaways included since mod_ssl is static. But then since SSL is not defined, everything in ssl.conf is ignored, leaving out the Seed config, causing it to revert to the compiled-in default. So what we need is for the SSLRandomSeed directives to always get loaded when mod_ssl is static, but not when it's dynamic...  ...Wait, shouldn't my first patch be okay then? Because in a dynamic situation if the mod_ssl module isn't loaded the bit I changed is already wrapped in an IFModule, so it should get loaded at all. If the modules not loaded, none of the ssl config gets run...   Well, that's what I get for relying on my memory ;) Your patch shouldn't do any harm in the dso case. I'm +1 on the change. Yep, this logic looks correct to me. I've committed a slightly changed version of your patch to the  2.1 tree and proposed it for backport to the 2.0 tree.  See http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/docs/conf/ssl-std.conf.in?r1=1.4&r2=1.5 Finally backported to 2.0 and thus in the next release. Thanks!			Erik Abele	Mads Toftum	Rob Meyer

At the moment the first resource is also available via <http://foo.example/bar/index.html> (if your DirectoryIndex is set to index.html) and there is no (simple) way to completely remove (that means answering to a request with a HTTP response of 404) this unwanted URL.

The httpd child continues to write logdata into the pipe, but there's no process reading from the pipe anymore.  Eventually the pipe fills up, and the httpd child just hangs.  This bug was discovered when doing a large Subversion commit with apache configured to use piped logging to 'rotatelogs'.  It's a pretty common setup, and it's likely to burn future Apache (and Subversion) users.  Joe Orton says, 'To fix this properly, I suppose piped loggers should not get SIGTERMedduring a graceful restart, they should read till EOF then exit(0): then when the last child attached to the piped logger for a particular generation quits, the pipe is closed and the piped logger terminates gracefully too, without losing log messages.'  Here's the complete mail thread:     http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40httpd.apache.org/msg19247.html	I've been pouring over Google search results trying to figure out the cause of an extremely similar bug which seems to affect the 1.3.x branch of the Apache HTTP server also.  Has there been any movement on this issue.  Is it likely 1.3.x would also have this problem? Yes, this bug also affects 1.3. Created an attachment (id=15021) Kill hung child httpd procs  This little script (requires Proc::ProcessTable) is a hack to find child processes other than the root one that have been around since before the last rotatelogs process. Just in case it's useful to anyone else... can run from cron. > processes other than the root one that have been around since before the last > rotatelogs process.  Sorry... s/last/first/ FWIW, I'm playing with a patch to prevent the hang.  Hopefully I can commit to 2.1 this weekend.  Changing rotatelogs to snarf up all entries from these gracefully dying children would be nice, but first order of business is to prevent the hang occurring, since it can occur with any piped logger, and it shouldn't depend on how reliable the piped logger is.  I can't reproduce the hang when I take care to close the read side of the logger pipe in the MPM children (i.e., the processes which serve requests and which would write to the logger pipe).  I just posted a patch and further comments to dev@httpd.  [PATCH] PR 26467 child process can hang when piped logger goes away A fix to avoid the hang has been committed to 2.1-dev and hopefully will be in 2.0.next.  I stuck a patch for 1.3.x at http://people.apache.org/~trawick/pr26467_13.txt  This 1.3 patch appears to Do The Right Thing, but YYMV.  I haven't tested it in detail.  I have patched the version of Apache 1.3 I am running on two web servers that use piped loggers and I can already see that the symptoms of this problem are gone.  There are no hanging PIDs being leftover at all anymore.  I had a script that went through and killed the ones that were clearly hanging previously, and I've modified it to only tell me if any would be killed for hanging.  None have come up yet, which would certainly never happen in the past even for the short time I've been running with the patch.  This is certainly not proof that the 1.3 patch is perfect or that it doesn't cause any other problems, but it definitely does the right thing as best I can tell.  What's the chances something like this could land in 1.3.34? Regarding the 1.3 patch: Thanks for the feedback.  I need to make sure it does the right thing on non-Unix, then I'll add it to 1.3 STATUS file, asking for approval to commit for 1.3.next. On Unix, just looking at the processes with lsof it is easy to see that it is doing the right thing and there should be no worries.  The 2.x fix has now been merged into the stable 2.0.x branch for the upcoming 2.0.55 release.  The hang is now fixed for 2.0.55, so marking this fixed.  Avoiding the problem completely (i.e. not forcibly killing piped loggers at restart) is a slightly different issue. Can someone clarify this bug for me?  We'd been having a hang about every 2-14  days that started once we turned on the DisableWin32AcceptEx option.  We  noticed that the hang occurred after the child process restarted for whatever  reason.  Usually this was not triggered by a graceful restart, but  occasionally it was.  Meaning it would show up in the logs, but a person  didn't usually choose to do a restart, something else caused it.  We figured the build up of rotatelogs had something to do with the problem, as  there were a ton of rotatelogs.exe sitting in there.  I noticed this bug  mentioned in the 2.0.55 release and tried the upgrade.  We've been pretty  stable since.  It hung once during a graceful restart after 29 days, and has  been up for 26 days since.  I'm confident this bug was causing the hang, but still notice a tremendous  number of rotatelogs.exe.  After a fresh reboot, there are about 6  rotatelogs.exe is the process list.  After 26 days on Parent Server Generation  14, we have 40+ rotatelogs.exe sitting in the process list.  When we hang, there's no way to recover without rebooting Windows.  At least  not that I'm aware of.  Apache seems to hang, tying up the socket(s), and  stopping and starting apache fails.  My concern is the number of accumulating rotatelogs, and the fact that we  still hung after a month under similar circumstances during a graceful  restart.  Of course once a month is better than every couple of days.  I just  wanted to share what we have been experiencing with this bug, and it's  apparent patch, and see if anyone could clarify what we are experiencing, if  it is/was related to this bug, and why we still see so many rotatelogs. *** Bug 40041 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Jeff Trawick	Joe Orton	Kevin Stange	Matthew Sullivan	Will Yardley

26554	null	RESOLVED		Peter Watkins	1075480860000	1176119718000		ApacheBench: add ability to override User-Agent header I need to benchmark a site that sends different versions of content depending on the User-Agent presented by the HTTP client. In order to benchmark the site's performance for the different 'browser variations', I need the ability to send benchmark requests with different User-Agent request header values. I have put together a patch for ab.c that adds a '-U' command line argument for overrriding the default value. Also my patch modifies the '-h' behavior so that it not only explains the -U option, but shows the default User-Agent that is compiled into ab, e.g.      -U attribute    User-Agent value to send instead of 'ApacheBench/2.0.40-dev'  I hope this patch (to be attached after this ticket is created) will be considered for inclusion into the project.  Thank you.	Created an attachment (id=10162) patch for support/ab.c to provide requested capability  An alternate design: Don't build default User-Agent header field if User-Agent was specified via the existing command-line option -H.  Created an attachment (id=10188) Jeff Trawick's alternate logic (use -H)  Jeff, that certainly works (a quick read of RFC 1945 suggests that the User-Agent header can come later in the request message, so moving the User-Agent to after the Accept request header appears to be RFC-compliant), and I've attached another patch implementing this.   I think I prefer the -U plan though, as  * it's less fragile (strstr() is case-sensitive & the more users type, the greater chance of error)   * this general idea, whether implemented as -U or special handling of -H, requires the -h usage() information to be updated, and requires about the same amount of code changes (so there's not much 'economy' argument against -U)  * [weak argument] adding -U is backwards-compatible (doesn't alter the order of headers or change the behavior of -H in any situations)  But I'd be happy either way, as either approach gives users more flexibility.  Thanks.  comments/opinions from other developers would of course be appreciated ;)  I believe that my revised patch for  http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31268 incorporates the fix this bug as well. Fixed in r526872. I went with Arvind's patch as a general fix for -H command-line switch behaviour.  Specify -H 'User-Agent: foobar/1.0' to ab to override the default User-Agent setting.

26562	null	CLOSED		Ken Avery	1075497540000	1083239401000		There appears to be a major memory leak in mod_ssl/OpenSSL I have been tracking this down for a couple of weeks and thought it was in the  code my company is developing and it appears that is not the case. In order to  eliminate our code from the mix and isolate the problem here is what I did:  This was done on Windows and Linux:  1. Download the latest Apache from www.apache.org.  2. Download the latest OpenSSL from www.openssl.org.  3. Build them both, with apache add the mod_ssl option and also for Linux use  the MPM worker module.  4. Install and modify the ssl.conf file ServerName value.  5. Run Apache (httpd)  6a. Run the Performance monitor on Windows and look at Private Bytes for the  second Apache process.  6b. On Linux run top -p pid(httpd1) -p pid(http2) ???.. -p pid(httpN) watching  the size of the processes  7. Set you browser to not cache requests and check for a new page every time.  8. Start fetching a page from https://localhost and keep refreshing the page.   So far 3 other engineers have reproduced this test because they did not believe  the problem could be in Apache mod_ssl/OpenSSL, they all verified that it leaks  like a sieve.  We were all trying to figure out why no one else has complained about such a  huge leak so we ran another test. We tried using the prefork MPM and it turns  out that worked fine. Based on the results it appears the OS is cleaning up  memory for the prefork module and the threaded model never gets its memory  freed. I have used a debugger on Windows and set break points on the  CRYPTO_malloc and CRYPTO_free functions and have seen gobs of memory  CRYPTO_malloc(ed) and not one time have I seen CRYPTO_free called. I was not  sure if having the OS cleanup memory was part of the design (if indeed that is  what is happening) or if there is potentially a problem in the OpenSSL memory  management code.  With all this said, I am by no means an expert on this code and could really  use some help understanding what is going on here? Any and all help is appreciated,  Ken	I posted two patches to fix memory leaks in issues 25659 and 25667.  I don't  know if they are directly related to what you are seeing but I haven't received  any feedback on whether anyone else has tried them out.  Let me knoe if you  think they may be related. David,  I tried both of the bug fixes you posted (25659, 25667) and they did not help,  I suspect the problem is related to the way threads handle memory verses  forked processes.  Ken FYI - I am seeing multiples of 8K chuncks of memroy disapear at a time. I  don't know if this helps? That would most likely be a heap bucket not being freed somewhere. I'm still unable to reproduce this on Linux.  Can you post the mod_ssl configuration you're using? Here is the ssl.conf file:  # # This is the Apache server configuration file providing SSL support. # It contains the configuration directives to instruct the server how to # serve pages over an https connection. For detailing information about these  # directives see <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html> # #   For the moment, see <URL:http://www.modssl.org/docs/> for this info.  #   The documents are still being prepared from material donated by the #   modssl project. #  # Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding # what they do.

When you need a different shutdown #   approach you can use one of the following variables: #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown: #     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no #     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates #     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use #     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where #     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert. #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown: #     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a #     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify #     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in #     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use #     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation #     works correctly.  #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP #   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable #   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable 'nokeepalive' for this. #   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround #   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables 'downgrade-1.0' and #   'force-response-1.0' for this. SetEnvIf User-Agent '.*MSIE.*' /          nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown /          downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0  #   Per-Server Logging: #   The home of a custom SSL log file. Use this when you want a #   compact non-error SSL logfile on a virtual host basis. CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log /           '%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x /'%r/' %b'  </VirtualHost>                                    </IfDefine>   BTW - Check your log file to see if there is a SIGNAL 11 SEGFAULT that will  cause Apache to restart the threads and make it appear that everything is OK. Here is some more info from on our Linux Heads:  While attempting to locate the cause for what appears to be a memory  consumption problem in the SSL code, the server segmentation faults. The first  worker child & all of its child threads continue to consume memory while the  parent stays the same or gets a little smaller.  The child threads never give  the memory back unless restarted.  Please advise if this is an expected  behavior.  Running with 'SSLSessionCache none' doesn't consume memory (and doesn't seg  fault), but it performs poorly when using 2048 bit keys.  I observed the segmentation fault issue in mod_ssl while running the small  script listed below.  Based on the stack information the issue appears to be  in shmcb_cton_memcpy() during an attempt to remove a session id.  The server  keeps on reponding, but all the child threads die and are restarted. I am not  sure what is happening, but the following variables seem to get corrupted:  The stack trace shows these are supposed to be:  src_offset=6402  src_len=10240  Inside the frame they have these values:  (gdb) print src_offset (in edi register) $55 = 3183473748   (gdb) print src_len    (in edx register)  $56 = 3183464512  The configuration file, and my initial debug session are attached.

Tried any different SSLMutex settings, e.g. 'SSLMutex default'?  Can you file a separate bug on that, and include the backtrace for the shmcb segfaults.  After tagging memory and running tests over the weekend it appears that calls  to OPENSSL_malloc in the following files failed to release memory by calling  the corresponding OPENSSL_free:  bn_bind.c - 494,788 outstanding OPENSSL_malloc bn_lib.c  - 123,673 outstanding OPENSSL_malloc  I am not sure how this relates to the Apache/mod_ssl threaded MPMs; though, it  does appear to be a problem.  Any ideas? I have narrowed it down to the function BN_BLINDING_new in the file  crypto/bn/bn_blind.c, the memory allocated for the BN_BLINDING structure never  gets freed. I am assuming that the BIGNUM structures allocated with BN_new  inside of BN_BLINDING never gets freed also.  Here are my test results after running 24 hours monitoring the OPENSSL_malloc  and OPENSSL_free calls:  1. BN_BLINDING ??? allocations 53,615, frees 0, outstanding 53,615  2. BN_new ??? allocations 8,347,200, frees 8,127,872 outstanding 219,328  3. I also track the heap and it grows proportional to the lack of BN frees The patches released to enable RSA blinding in OpenSSL initially had thread-safety issues; the fixes for those issues may well have introduced leaks...  Try reproducing using a vanilla OpenSSL 0.9.6m release: if it's still a problem, report the bug back at openssl.org.  It seems unlikely this is a mod_ssl issue now, agreed?    The blinging leak is fixed in OpenSSL 0.9.7d - mod_ssl still has a huge leak in  the threaded MPMs using session caching Can you try the following patch ? It seems to fix the mem leak on HP-UX atleast :)  RCS file: /home/cvs/httpd-2.0/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_init.c,v retrieving revision 1.126 diff -u -r1.126 ssl_engine_init.c --- ssl_engine_init.c   5 Mar 2004 02:44:40 -0000       1.126 +++ ssl_engine_init.c   25 Mar 2004 23:27:02 -0000 @@ -450,7 +450,7 @@           * to ignore process local-caching and           * to always get/set/delete sessions using mod_ssl's callbacks.           */ -        cache_mode = SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER|SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP; +        cache_mode = SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER|SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL;      }        SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(ctx, cache_mode);  Is this fixed in CVS or not?

For this to work, util_ldap would have to resolve the relative link against ServerRoot before passing the filename.  I have replace the call to apr_pstrdup() with ap_server_root_relative() which  should allow relative paths to be resolved against ServerRoot.  It has also  been proposed for backport. Patch has been backported to the 2.0 branch This does not appear to be fixed as of 2.0.49. When using a relative path to ServerRoot in the httpd.conf file it did not throw any errors or give any indication in the logs that it was not parsing the file. On the contrary it seemed to indicate all was well. I have posted the out put in another bug (possible dup?) #22711 This was broken in 2.0.49.  The fix wasn't back ported until 2.0.50 *** Bug 22711 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Brad Nicholes	Graham Leggett	gregaryh@juno.com

If I comment out the 'ScoreBoardFile' directive, the server starts fine, and no scoreboard file is created (as expected).

27271	null	CLOSED		Michael Grossniklaus	1077831300000	1098712207000		mod_auth_ldap on active directory fail after entering false credentials I'm running Apache/2.0.48 (Win32) with mod_ssl/2.0.48 and OpenSSL/0.9.7c on a  Windows 2000 Advanced Server SP4. I've configured the mod_auth_ldap that came  with the Apache distribution to validate user accounts against my ADS.  Therefore I've included the following lines into my httpd.conf:  LoadModule auth_ldap_module modules/mod_auth_ldap.so LoadModule ldap_module  modules/util_ldap.so  and  <Directory 'C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs'> Options Indexes  FollowSymLinks AllowOverride None Order allow,deny Allow from all  AuthName 'Global Information Systems Domain' AuthType Basic AuthLDAPUrl 'ldap://localhost/dc=globis,dc=infk,dc=d,dc=ethz,dc=ch? sAMAccountName?sub?(objectCategory=Person)(objectClass=User)' AuthLDAPBindDN 'cn=LDAPUser,cn=Users,dc=globis,dc=infk,dc=d,dc=ethz,dc=ch' AuthLDAPBindPassword '*********' require valid-user </Directory>  Now, the problem is REALLY strange! As long as the users enter their  credentials correctly, everything works perfectly... But (and it's a big BUT)  as soon someone enters a wrong user/password, the validation always fails from  any machine and browser until the Apache service is restarted...  The following warning is logged in the 'error_log' file once: [Thu Feb 26 21:37:13 2004] [warn] [client 129.132.13.8] [6884] auth_ldap  authenticate: user abc authentication failed; URI / [ldap_simple_bind_s() to check user credentials failed][Invalid Credentials]  Every subsequent attempt to log in produces the following error: [Thu Feb 26 21:37:37 2004] [warn] [client 129.132.13.8] [6884] auth_ldap  authenticate: user abc authentication failed; URI / [User not found][No Such  Object] [Thu Feb 26 21:38:39 2004] [warn] [client 129.132.13.28] [6884]  auth_ldap authenticate: user xyz authentication failed; URI / [User not found] [No Such Object]	Created an attachment (id=10575) Apache Configuration File  Could it be a caching problem of mod_ldap? You have answered the question yourself. When a user enter wrong credentials, the cached connection is seen by the ldap server as an anonymous connection and by the  cache of ldap_util as a bind connection to 'cn=LDAPUser...', so it is reused for other authentication connection without success since anonymous connection has no access to an Active Directory users list. See bug 27134 for details and a patch to try. Let us known if you succeed with that patch. Please try the patch at http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=27748 and tell me if it fixes this problem. This patch has been applied to v2.1.0-dev, and awaits backporting to v2.0.50-dev.  Is this bug still present, or can I close it?  Graham,  I think this was fixed in 2.0.50. I just tested with 2.0.52 and password prompting works like it should. Will close - thanks for confirming this for me! 			Denis Gervalle	Graham Leggett	Jari Ahonen	Michael Grossniklaus

Hopefully that gives enough time for someone with the capability to download it and replace this report text with it. http://dione.no-ip.org/~alexis/ticking.txt  This is a summary of a bug reported on the dev mailing list this month.  See http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@httpd.apache.org/msg19720.html for the full thread.  Ok, first, what I'm running:  \tApache/2.1.0-dev (Unix) DAV/2 SVN/0.36.0+  More specifically, I got and compiled Apache2 from CVS on:  \tdione:/usr/server/opt/apache2/bin# ls -l httpd \t-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      3221030 Jan 15 18:01 httpd \tdione:/usr/server/opt/apache2/bin#   The OS is:  \tLinux dione 2.4.16 #1 Sat Mar 9 19:04:14 CET 2002 i686 GNU/Linux  Now the problem description:  The problem I am reporting here seems to have been in since Apache 2.0.47 or 2.0.48.   About once every three weeks it happens that the hard disk of the machine where I run apache2 starts audibly 'ticking' - i.e. it starts making some sort of non-cached access (maybe the log writing below?) at a rate of once per second.  Actually, recently it seems to be happening every couple of days.  The server could still serve other pages without problem, so there was no DoS.  Now what I investigated:  The first few times it happened I rebooted, assuming the disk or controller had got its knickers in a twist. The next times I shutdown all of the locally added init.d scripts which fixed it. The next time I shut down half of those init.d scripts which worked. Next time half of that half, and so on until eventually I traced it down to the httpd daemon, which was yesterday!   I checked the apache logs and I see this in error_log:          [Mon Feb 16 23:35:33 2004] [warn] (97)Address family not supported by protocol: get socket to connect to listener         [Mon Feb 16 23:35:34 2004] [warn] (97)Address family not supported by protocol: get socket to connect to listener         [Mon Feb 16 23:35:35 2004] [warn] (97)Address family not supported by protocol: get socket to connect to listener         [Mon Feb 16 23:35:36 2004] [warn] (97)Address family not supported by protocol: get socket to connect to listener         [Mon Feb 16 23:35:37 2004] [warn] (97)Address family not supported by protocol: get socket to connect to listener \t....   It goes on until I restart httpd.

Alexis Huxley ahuxley@gmx.net	Just confirm: you only see this bug using HEAD not 2.0.48? I saw this problem in HEAD (Jan 15 2004 17:00 GMT).  I saw it also in earlier HEADs, my guess is, since about six months ago. It's  a little difficult to judge with what version it started happening because it  only started happening once my pages starting getting more hits.   But, yes, I have only experienced it in HEADs, and not official releases, but then I *only* install HEADs becaause I've been reinstalling latest  apache2 HEAD at the same time as each new Subversion release comes out.  I've since installed HEAD (Feb 28 21:?? GMT). I will be sure to add a comment regarding its behaviour in a couple of weeks. Thanks for the detailed report - this should be fixed by the following change:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/server/mpm_common.c?r1=1.117&r2=1.118			Alexis Huxley	Joe Orton

27428	null	CLOSED		keilh	1078394040000	1078841432000		ssl shutdown does not work The ssl shutdown is handeld in 'ssl_filter_io_shutdown(..)', wich will be invoked as a cleanup handler. But the cleanup handlers will by invoked _after_ 'shutdown()' is called for the socket,  disabling any further write operation.  So the client does not recieve any ssl shutdown message. (The mod_ssl default is SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN)  That behaviour can be verified using ssldump.	This is fixed in the forthcoming 2.0.49 release; thanks for the report.			Joe Orton
27525	null	RESOLVED		1icharp	1078782900000	1130520727000		 failed on startssl Hello, i am trying to startssl on Sun-sparc Solaris 9 machine with Apache2.0.48 It gives the follwing error.  [Tue Mar 09 19:40:37 2004] [crit] [Tue Mar 09 19:40:37 2004] file vhost.c, line  232, assertion 'rv == APR_SUCCESS' failed Abort - core dumped  it works fine with 'start' option. i have installed the Sun recommened Patch cluster.  Can u suggest something.  Regards, Dheerajk.	Just to verify that we know which getaddrinfo call is failing, please try the test program gawild.c, which I'll attach in a sec.  It *should* run like this:  [trawick@sol9 platform_test]$ gcc -Wall -o gawild gawild.c -lsocket -lnsl [trawick@sol9 platform_test]$ ./gawild  it worked [trawick@sol9 platform_test]$ Created an attachment (id=10713) getaddrinfo(255.255.255.255)  Please re-open bug when you get a chance to try attached program on the Solaris box with the problem and report the results.  Thanks!  I have the same problem on Solaris 9, httpd 2.0.49. I tried the program and the  output is: getaddrinfo->1  Any clue? I've run the tool on two sun sparc systems with different results.    fwa$ ~/gawild   it worked   fwa$ uname -a   SunOS fwa 5.8 Generic_108528-23 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-480R    tii$ ~/gawild   getaddrinfo->1   fwa$ uname -a   SunOS tii 5.8 Generic_108528-23 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-V210  I wouldn't expect it'd be a hardware issue.  As expected, apache runs fine on  one of them but not the other.  In a different PR, it was suggested that it can fail when DNS is disabled but work otherwise.  Is that possibly the case, or is there a difference in DNS search order between the two machines?  I think we need to change APR to deal with this consistently.

I verified that it also fails when:             hosts:     nis [NOTFOUND=return] files  It fails with:             hosts:     files nis [NOTFOUND=return] files  It works with:             hosts:     files dns nis [NOTFOUND=return] files Someone marked this as fixed; this case should at least be handled gracefully without an abort() so it's not really fixed. This is a very annoying and unintuitive situation. We are using mod_ssl with Apache 2.0.52 in Solaris 9/x86 and as we turned on the SSL it just occured and started dumping core. We also turned off the ServerName directive hoping that it will make it go away but still continued.  Need some graceful error message at the least. *** Bug 21682 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 28537 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** This happens when the VirtualHost entry contains _default_.

Where does _default_ get it's address from (dns? etx/hosts?) ??  On our server when we change _default_ to an IP Address it no longer core dumps, where does _default_ get populated from?  This bug is indeed caused by a Solaris bug, namely by http://bugs.opensolaris.org/view_bug.do?bug_id=4944187 which causes the getaddrinfo('255.255.255.255',...) to fail.  Bug 4944187 is scheduled to be fixed in the following forthcoming Solaris 10 patches:  125553-03 SunOS 5.10: libnsl and nfsmapid patch 125554-03 SunOS 5.10_x86: libnsl and nfsmapid patch  These two patches still have to pass the patch test cycle. Even if the behaviour of Solaris getaddrinfo must be considered faulty, apache could easily account for this misbehaviour, since the function find_adresses comes in two versions in srclib/apr/network_io/unix/sockaddr.c, the first calling call_resolver and, from there, getaddrinfo; the second treating addresses 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 specially and otherwise calling gethostbyname or gethostbyname_r. Thus, there is an simply way to fix this: in srclib/apr/configure, change the test address for getaddrinfo (line numbers for httpd-2.2.8): @@ -46266,7 +46266,7 @@      memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));      hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;      hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; -    error = getaddrinfo('127.0.0.1', NULL, &hints, &ai); +    error = getaddrinfo('255.255.255.255', NULL, &hints, &ai);      if (error) {          exit(1);      } Then the test would fail in faulty Solaris and the second version of find_adresses be used.

There is a problem with mod_proxy when it tries to connect (forward, internal  proxy) to the domain name, which points to several IP addresses.  Technically,  it appears when I'm trying to use mod_rewrite RewriteRule with the internal  proxying facility.  I am still not very sure who's an originator of the  problem, mod_rewrite or mod_proxy.  Eg. I'm using the mod_rewrite with [proxy|P] directive to have the internal  proxying for the specific address to http://www.domain.com/. But the domain  http://www.domain.com/ points to several IP addresses, which is used for fail- over and (or?) some kind of load-balancing, eg.:  www.domain.com. IN A 10.0.10.1                 IN A 10.0.10.2                 IN A 10.0.10.3  Some of IPs generate connection reset, and supposedly mod_proxy should try  another IP address to connect. Unfortunetly, it does not this, and if it  recieves connection reset before the correct answer (eg. it tried broken  address before the working one) mod_proxy just hangs up with the nasty 502  error like this one:  Proxy Error The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server. The proxy server could not handle the request GET /test/1231.  Reason: Could not connect to remote machine: Invalid argument  and the log file says:  [Tue Mar 9 06:30:25 2004] [error] [client 1.2.59.190] (22)Invalid argument:  proxy connect to 10.0.10.1 port 80 failed  Likely, IE, Squid and a lot of different browsers and proxies handle this  situation just fine, but not mod_proxy. Yes, I am aware that this is not RFC- documented way of handling such situation, but looks pretty reasonable.	As I discovered, it looks like mod_proxy problem, but not mod_rewrite one. Actually, as it comes from the debug logs mod_proxy tries to do other  connections after it receives 'Connection refused' or 'Operation timed out',  but somehow hangs up with 'Invalid argument' parameter.

27550	null	RESOLVED		Andres Salomon	1078870200000	1116884969000		pcre symbol issues for apache modules Currently, apache2 includes a full version of pcre-3.9 in its sources; this is built during compilation, and statically linked against.  The symbols from this library, are exported to apache modules.  This is undesirable for some apache modules; for example, php.  Php links against libpcre on the system; however, it will happily pick up the pcre symbols in the apache binary before the symbols in the pcre shared library.  This breaks php functions such as pcre_match(), which expect a relatively new version of pcre to be used (3.9 doesn't cut it; it always fails w/ that).  There are a number of solutions, here.  I attempted upgrading the pcre included in apache; however, I had no way to know if the various win32 hacks introduced to the pcre build system would still work.  I opted to not bother, since I have no way to test such work except for on a unix system.  An alternate solution is to check for pcre on the build system, and link against that instead of building pcre for apache.  This works, but introduces other issues.  With apache2 looking for the posix regex functions in shared libraries, it ends up using the glibc implementations for reg{comp,exec,free,error} instead of the pcre implementations of these function.  On my system, the glibc implementations segfault somewhere inside glibc; it's much safer to stick w/ the pcre versions.  So, aside from the autoconf-ery that's necessary to do the pcre system checks, there are some additional code changes necessary to make sure that the pcre functions are called instead of the glibc functions.  This is mainly some ugly code duplication.  The patch that implements this change is here: <http://sloth.voxel.net/~dilinger/020-external_pcre.patch>  A third solution is to simply change the internal pcre library to have its own namespace.  This ensures that apache uses a pcre that it's been fully tested with, while apache modules don't use them in place of a system-supplied pcre.  What I've done in the following patch is to prefix the posix regex functions in pcre with ap_pcreposix, and to prefix the other pcre regex functions with ap_pcre.  The interface that apache is _suppose to_ export to modules has not changed.  That patch is here: <http://sloth.voxel.net/~dilinger/021-pcre_mangle_symbols.patch>  I prefer the 021-pcre_mangle_symbols.patch patch, even though it's larger; it ensures stability, at the cost of some code duplication.  The 020-external_pcre.patch patch isn't as clean as I'd hoped, and for the added complexity, not much memory is saved.  Anyways, links to both patches are supplied so that you folks can decide between the preferred method.  Please consider applying either one of my patches, or an equivalent patch, so that pcre issues in external apache modules are solved.

I can't get my mod_caml module working with Apache 2.0 until it's fixed.  This prevents a significant userbase from migrating to Apache 2.  My duplicate bug report contains some other information: Bug 23952 I just had this problem as well, trying to install a Caml based wiki. If I add the 'LoadModule caml_module modules/mod_caml.so' to my httpd.conf file, apache just keeps segfaulting.  Unfortunately this is on a server where we need apache2, so this means that until this fix is integrated, I cannot use mod_caml (and every other mod that need a recent pcre library, it seems). Adding PatchAvailable keyword just building httpd2.0.51 ...  it seems this bug is STILL not resolved.  there's a demonstrated, working patch (cref: Andreas, below) that fixed the issue in 2.0.50, and  (seemingly) applies to 2.0.51 as well ...   is there a particular reason why this known/reported/fixed issue is NOT being integrated?  thx,  richard There are some subtle issues with this:   1) with an httpd built to use an external pcre, the include/pcre.h which gets installed does not match the pcre which is actually used.  It's possible that some third-party modules will depend on this.  2) Renaming both the reg* and pcre_* functions is a binary compatibility issue. hi,  i'm back again!  i'm building httpd 2.0.52 + php 5.0.2 on OSX 10.3.5  the ONLY way i'm able to get httpd & php to 'play nice' together -- avoiding later/'downstream' pcre  conflicts -- is to make sure that they're built using the SAME version of pcre.  there are two options to that end ...  (a)         build httpd w/ INTERNAL pcre (v3.9)         build external pcre3.9         build php 502 against pcre3.9/external  (b)         apply Andreas' patch to httpd (*luckily* the patch still works against 2.0.52 ...)         build external pcre5.0         build httpd 2.0.52 against pcre5.0/external         build php 5.0.2 against pcre5.0/external  (a), of course, locks PHP into the use of pcre3.9 ... which is simply not acceptable/tenable for a variety  of other apps that need >= v4.5  so, (b) is really the only functional option here ...  acknowledging 'possible subleties' from  Joe's reference above, the php issue is neither subtle, nor  simply possible ... others as well (cref above) are noting problems with, e.g., mod_caml that requires a  more recent pcre.  what need to be done to get this solution addressed/integrated?  even ASSIGNED would be a good start!  this has been an unaddressed issue problem for QUITE awhile ...  richard Agree with the previous comment.  mod_caml cannot use anything except an external, modern PCRE, so somehow linking it against Apache's ancient version of PCRE is a non-starter, even if it were possible.  This bug is a showstopper for a variety of important modules, so it should be fixed (particularly, since there's even a patch to do it). Created an attachment (id=13377) Amended version of patch by Andres Salomon, with typo fixed by Paul Argentoff  The following notes were sent to me by Paul Argentoff to accompany the preceeding patch.    - - - - - -  This is patch by Andres Salomon <dilinger@voxel.net>, with typo fixed by Paul Argentoff <argentoff@rtelekom.ru>  This patch fixes problems seen by apache modules attempting to run regex stuff, and getting apache's internal pcre implementation.  It contains two parts; the first (the autoconf stuff) checks if libpcre is installed on the host system.  If it is, that pcre is used to build apache2.  If it's not, apache2 compiles its own pcre, and statically links against it.    The second part of this patch forces pcre to be used.  Apache, by default, calls the posix regex functions (reg{exec,comp,free,error}) internally.  If glibc was sane, this would be fine.  Unfortunately, it's not.  So, when apache calls these regex functions, it's anyones guess as to whether it will use glibc's regex functions, or the pcre regex functions.  The glibc regex functions segfault (within glibc) on my system.  So, to ensure sanity, we force use of pcre regex functions.  I need to do a bit more testing w/ apache's internal pcre, but for debian's purposes (pcre in /usr), it works fine.  Pleeeeeeeeeeeeease incorporate this fix?  I'll bake you cookies! Ok, I've created a new patch that should supercede both other patches.  This patch checks for regex support via libc, and will use that if found.  If the libc doesn't support POSIX.2 regex functions, it will then check for an external pcre; if found, it links against that.  If it doesn't find that, it finally falls back to compiling and linking against its own internal pcre library.  This patch is also significantly smaller than my other two patches, as it doesn't require any widespread symbol changes.  I've tested compilation with and without regex.h and pcre-dev.  Testers whose libc specifically lacks regex support are requested (all testers welcome, of course :)  I'll follow up w/ fixes as necessary. We won't use any POSIX regex stuff. The PCRE is used on purpose... Created an attachment (id=13661) more intelligent patch to link against PCRE  Patch against apache 2.0.52; use libc's regex functions, falling back to external pcre, and finally building internal pcre only if absolutely necessary. (In reply to comment #17) > We won't use any POSIX regex stuff. The PCRE is used on purpose...  Why not?  What specifically is broken regarding the libc-provided POSIX regex stuff?  And, why not test for breakage, instead of unconditionally using PCRE when   it's probably not even necessary? Consistency among the various installations and way more power. In that case, instead of using the POSIX functions, we should probably just be using the PCRE functions... That's a good point and I personally agree. This should be discussed on dev@ anyway. The best would be with a patch backhand :) More than that, httpd *cannot* use a real POSIX regex implementation rather than PCRE: even the default config actually uses some of the Perl extensions to the regex grammar (the '(?:' stuff IIRC?). This is all now done on the trunk based on Andres' patches - thanks a lot!  Again, it can't really be backported to 2.0, unfortunately, because it changes the module interface. hi,  > Again, it can't really be backported to 2.0, unfortunately, because it changes the module interface.  so iiuc, then, we've two options at this point:  (1) STABLE 2.0.x release source + Andres' patches (assuming/hoping they continue to apply ...)

27748	null	CLOSED		William Leumas	1079541360000	1085181526000		ldap auth periodically fails, requires restart Over time (a few days, with an average of 350k hits of which 25k are authed with auth_ldap) it will stop authenticating random users, with the error:  [Wed Mar 17 08:40:51 2004] [warn] [client 147.178.68.203] [26904] auth_ldap authenticate: user {username} authentication failed; URI {path} [User not found][No such object]  It does this in the middle of a functional session (i.e. the user was logged in, clicking around and suddenly pop, no access).  The 'fix' is to restart the webserver.  I presume this is a cacheing issue.  We are running 2.0.49rc1	This is linked against OpenLDAP stable 2.1.25.  Is there a way to perhaps turn off the cache, to see if that is what is causing the problem?  I have written a perl script that watches the log for this error and immediately cross-checks LDAP for the user, if the user exists it restarts Apache.  We are seeing about 30 restarts a day. Created an attachment (id=11078) fix for ldap rebinding failures  The problem is in the poor way the ldap session is managed (which could cause other severe problems, if individual users cannot browse the tree, and it should be re-considered).  Kurt Olsen has found this problem and come up with a quick fix (see patch).  Note: this also relates to bug# 17274.  Kurt's description:  -------------- In the file util_ldap.c, in the function util_ldap_cache_checkuserid, when a user tries to authenticate the module takes these steps:  1) check the cache, returning success or failure if results cached. 2) open a connection via the function util_ldap_connection_open, using the ldc struct.    if ldc->bound = 1, then don't do anything in util_ldap_connection_open. 3) do a search to validate, and locate the dn for, the username provided. 4) verify that there is only 1 result of the search in #3. 5) verify that the password is non empty. 6) rebind with the dn found in step 3 with the password provided, using the ldc struct.    if there is a failure then return failure status.    on success update cache and return success status.  The problem is that the ldc used in #6 is the same ldc used to lookup a user's dn in the tree.  So if the password is incorrect then the ldap_simple_bind_s used to verify the password will have screwed up the ldc->ldap binding. The next time this ldc struct is used, the ldc->bound value is set to 1, but the actual valid bind has been hosed. One simple fix is to add an 'ldc->bound = 0;' into the two tests for failure after the ldap_simple_bind_s. This causes the util_ldap_connection_open to re-bind with the proper DN prior to looking up users.  Even in the case where the users are logging in correctly, there is still the problem that when user A authenticates the ldc->ldap bind is now bound with his username and password. If user A doesn't have rights to search the tree, then when user B comes along at a later point in time the search for user B's dn in the tree will fail. The correct fix would be to create an util_ldap_connection_t *foo; that would be used for testing provided passwords, but would not have an impact on the ldc struct used for searching and what not.  Kurt Olsen Not fixed in the code yet... adding Patchavailable keyword. Additional bugs with this issue and some of them also have fixes:  17274 17599 18661 21787 24595 24683 (probably, commentary is old) 27134 27271  And  28413 may be the same thing, but it's not really clear except that they experience failures against AD.  I think that the comment that a connection should be marked as unbound after any user bind is the proper solution. The patch included in this report only marks unbound upon auth failures. Adding an ldc->bound = 0; at line 847 in util_ldap.c (release 2.0.49) should fix both issues I have addressed in my re-explanation of the problem. The attached patch has been committed to v2.1.0-dev, and is included against v2.0.49.  Please test and tell me whether this fixes the problem.  Created an attachment (id=11618) Rollup of LDAP fixes to v2.1.0 against v2.0.49  The attachment includes bnicholes fix:      *) mod_ldap calls ldap_simple_bind_s() to validate the user        credentials.  If the bind fails, the connection is left        in an unbound state.  Make sure that the ldap connection        record is updated to show that the connection is no longer        bound.  *** Bug 25764 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 17599 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 21787 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 24595 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 27134 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 24683 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 18661 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Fixed in v2.0.50-dev. I repeated my test set-up that I'd been using under bug 27134, with the roll-up patch 11618 from bug 27748. This was on Red Hat Linux 9.0, building Apache from patched 2.0.49 sources (not Red Hat sources)  This uses two test data sets with 11 valid username/password pairs and some pseudo-random failures. One data set walks through the usernames in nearly serial order (because this will tend to show the worst-case usage of the connection pool). This makes 103 requests. The other data set uses a more random series of usernames. This makes 804 requests.  The results look good.  I'm now getting no unexpected authentication results, and socket usage looks similar to Denis Gervalle's previous patch.  I still have the warning 'LDAP cache: Unable to init  Shared Cache: no file', but I suppose that's a different issue.  I did the tests first with the default settings of  StartServers         5 MinSpareServers      5 MaxSpareServers     10 MaxClients         150 MaxRequestsPerChild  0  For comparison, I set up a low process number test with:  StartServers         1 MinSpareServers      1 MaxSpareServers     1 MaxClients         150 MaxRequestsPerChild  0  and high process number test with:  StartServers         10 MinSpareServers      10 MaxSpareServers     20 MaxClients         150 MaxRequestsPerChild  0  All the tests give correct results (authentication works or fails as expected).  I looked at sockets in use with 'netstat -an' on the LDAP server.  With the default prefork process config: the serial data set left 9 sockets to the LDAP server in use at the end; the random data set left 4 sockets in use at the end  With the 'low process' config: the serial data set left 1 socket in use at the end; the random data set left 0 sockets in use at the end  With the 'high process' config the serial data set left 14 sockets in use at the end; the random data set left 11 sockets in use at the end;  I'm guessing that if I could get rid of the 'Unable to init  Shared Cache' warning I'd get results more like the 'low process' config. Can anyone suggest another fix/bug that applies to that issue? 			Albert Lunde	Andr?? Malo	Graham Leggett	Kurt Olsen	William Leumas

While attempting to locate the cause for what appears to be a memory  consumption problem in the SSL code, the server segmentation faults. The first  worker child & all of its child threads continue to consume memory while the  parent stays the same or gets a little smaller.  The child threads never give  the memory back unless restarted.  Please advise if this is an expected  behavior.  Running with 'SSLSessionCache none' doesn't consume memory (and doesn't seg  fault), but it performs poorly when using 2048 bit keys.  I observed the segmentation fault issue in mod_ssl while running the small  script listed below.  Based on the stack information the issue appears to be  in shmcb_cton_memcpy() during an attempt to remove a session id.  The server  keeps on reponding, but all the child threads die and are restarted. I am not  sure what is happening, but the following variables seem to get corrupted:  The stack trace shows these are supposed to be:  src_offset=6402  src_len=10240  Inside the frame they have these values:  (gdb) print src_offset (in edi register) $55 = 3183473748   (gdb) print src_len    (in edx register)  $56 = 3183464512  The configuration file, and my initial debug session are attached.

I attempted to  using either SSLMutex  file:logs/ssl_mutex  or  SSLMutex  default.  It takes  longer with SSLMutex default to seg fault, but the stack trace is basically the  same.  The debug error_log traces are available for both test runs if you want  them.   Finally the src_offest & src_len variables are not changing.  GDB just doesn't  reset the registers when you move back in the stack frame. It seems to me that src_offset and src_len are getting corrupted somehow, but it's not  obvious to me where or how this is happening. The versions you're using of redhat,  glibc, gcc (etc) are a little dated. and though I'm reluctant to dismiss the issue as  being old tools, it would certainly be something to consider - if you're able to build  using a different gcc or mess with the optimisation levels, that might hint as to whether  this is compiler sensitive or something more macabre.    Also, is it possible to insert some debugging lines in the last two frames around the  problem area to dump the exact values being passed around? I'm curious how and  where those values are getting mangled. As/when you hit a segfault, it would be useful  to have something to help pinpoint where the corruption was introduced. (Another  possible hint: could those 'corrupt' values actually be some unsigned representation  of a negative - indicating a possible bug in the 'cyclic' logic?) I've added myself to the  CC line for this ticket, please let me know how you get on with this.    Logging messages were added into the function to print out the values for  src_len and src_offset, and they were actually not changing.  The seg fault is  in memcpy() frame #0. When you move back to frame #1 to examine things, gdb 5.2- 2 does not reload the registers.  Local variables were created inside the  function, and assigned the values src_offset & src_len upon entry. The end  result was the same (seg fault).  It could be the tools, but everything is fine  for 15-20 minutes.  The function is called 305 times before a failure with the  last three calls shown below:   CALLER == shmcb_remove_session_id() CALLED == shmcb_cyclic_cton_memcpy()  [Wed Mar 17 17:13:20 2004] [info] CALLER: header->cache_data_size=7190   src_offset=3972 src_len=10240 [Wed Mar 17 17:13:20 2004] [info] CALLED: buff_size=7190 src_offset=3972,  src_len=10240 [Wed Mar 17 17:13:20 2004] [info] CALLER: header->cache_data_size=7190   src_offset=7166 src_len=10240 [Wed Mar 17 17:13:20 2004] [info] CALLED: buff_size=7190 src_offset=7166,  src_len=10240   I have two debug traces. Ouch, ok - I have this gloomy sense that I'm about to dive back into apache code ...    I notice you're on apache 2.0.48 ... I could try to help track the problem in that version  and worry about migrating it (if applicable) to cvs after, but to avoid the potential for  logjams with other issues already fixed, are you able to move to 2.0.49, or better still,  CVS (head or 2.0.**-stable)? At the least, have you diffed the ssl module source  against later releases or CVS to check if any fixes have already been made that might  cover this?    Whatever you do w.r.t. apache versions - please email me a copy of the first few  pages of a *trace* log during startup (this should give me all the shmcb geometry  settings), and then the last few pages leading up to your first crash. I noticed from the  info you've already provided that you are caching sessions around ~10Kb, which  would indicate that you're using client-authentication and probably with some biggish  certs (or longish cert-chains). My hunch is that this is triggering some wrap-around  issue, either in the cyclic logic itself or in the use of variables of insufficient size.    Please mail me the details privately, no point drowning the bugzilla database. As/when  I have potential suggestions/fixes, how should we handle that? Can I send you diffs to  try? Can I shell to a box where this can be reproduced? Thanks again for the detailed  report.  Geoff's fix for this is now committed to HEAD and the 2.0 branch - thanks for the report, and thanks to Geoff for tracking it down.			Geoff Thorpe	Jeff Potter	Joe Orton	Ken Avery

The RFC 2616 does not define this restriction. The attempt to PUT a file > 2GB results in a 400 Bad Request response.  Remark: A change from int to long has impacts to all depending SW as there is  mod_jp, tomcat, servlets, httpclient, etc.	It's already (read as) a long using strtol.  I'm wondering if should use strtoll if available. Any ideas? Interesting: yes, it should probably use apr_atoi64 and check for overflow if sizeof(apr_int64_t) > sizeof(apr_off_t) .

I have verified this with to a minimum a modified httpd.conf file that I start manually with '/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -f /path/to/alternate/conf/httpd.conf -k start'.  Although this can easily be solved by explicitly adding the directive 'Scriptsock /path/to/alternate/logs/cgisock' to the 'httpd.conf' file, IMHO I consider this being a bug.	what does 'ServerRoot directive of my default server' mean?  default VirtualHost container, or the main settings outside of any VirtualHost directive?  looking at the mod_cgid code I can't see why mod_cgid wouldn't be influenced by the main ServerRoot setting (outside of any VirtualHost container), so I want to be sure what 'default server' means  note that there is a loosely-related mod_cgid bug: if you have ScriptSock directive inside VirtualHost, some funky stuff can happen; in fact mod_cgid should disallow that, as there is no cgid daemon per virtual host, and thus there is only one socket ignore previous comment; problem is easy to see ;) Funny, I was just about to clarify :-)  Best Regards, Rolf Sponsel Fixed in 2.1-dev.

That is a problem. mod_rewrite now treats the result string 'proxy:http://www.apache.org/' as a relative path, which was a bug fix in 2.0.49 (for some other example, but ...).  Frankly speaking, your rules depend on unsupported API internals, so you cannot expect that they work forever.  Anyway: Can you try what happens if you just take the rules out of the <Proxy> container? (That's even the next problem, mod_rewrite was never designed for use within <Proxy>). > Frankly speaking, your rules depend on unsupported API internals  I didn't even know that this setup was unsupported ;)  It worked with only minor changes (<Location proxy:*> changed to <Proxy *>) from a  very old apache 1.3 through 2.0.48 without problems.  I will try your suggestion on monday, when I can reach my test-box again.  I just tried your suggestion of placing the RewriteRules outside of <Proxy>:  The Rules are tested only for local connections, not for connections proxied through the apache. Thus they are called exactly when I don't need any rewriting.  I'm back to apache 2.0.48 for now.  Well, thanks. I'm investigating how to fix it somehow. I've nailed the problem in 2.1 and proposed it for backport into the 2.0 branch.  If you want to to try it out, here's a patch against 2.0: <http://cvs.apache.org/~nd/mod_rewrite.c.patch> Just a small follow-up:  Your patch fixes my problems with 2.0.49, the rewrite/filter rules are working again.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for the feedback :-) This bug is in 2.0.50 too, and the same patch as for 2.0.49 still fixes it.  Well, the fix was finally reviewed and will be in 2.0.51.			Andr??

Curious!    I don't know why, but it crashed for me in this line. When I was looking into the code, I've found the first wrong line and subimitted both of them. I think it is related with pool cleanups. Nobody chimed in with an explanation for exactly why the 'if (score_idx != NULL)' is needed, so I would prefer not to commit that.  However, that's no reason to hold up the other fix, which should have been committed long ago.  Please re-open the PR if you find out why the extra check was needed.  Thanks for your fix!

I cannot find such a Makefile in the Apache Httpd 2.0.49 distribution (probably missing from previous versions too), neither in the build directory, nor in the install directory. The makefile found in 'modules/ssl' doesn't make seem to be the one either, and there is non in the 'certs' directory of the build tree. Thus IMHO, neither the description of SSLCACertificatePath in the manual, nor the explanation of the directive in 'ssl[-std].conf' file seem to reflect the reality of today.  --- from the manual --- The files in this directory have to be PEM-encoded and are accessed through hash  filenames. So usually you can't just place the Certificate files there: you also have to create symbolic links named hash-value.N. And you should always make sure this directory contains the appropriate symbolic links. Use the Makefile which comes with mod_ssl to accomplish this task. -----------------------  Where can I find that makefile or a tool for creating those symbolic links? Shouldn't such a tool be installed in 'bin/' together with 'httpd' and 'apachectrl'?  Best Regards, Rolf Sponsel	I think this makefile is a relic of the days before mod_ssl was part of httpd.  Should we just remove the docs about it? This has been fixed in 2.0.

28167	null	RESOLVED		Brian Pinkerton	1080932700000	1124917771000		t close the main socket immediately on receipt of a graceful restart If you're running Apache behind a load balancer, an effective way to stop Apache gracefully is to change the listen port to something else (say 81) and gracefully restart.  Long-lived downloads will continue (making modem users happy) but new connections will (in theory) be refused, allowing your load balancer to pick another box immediately.  After all connections finish or time out, Apache will stop.  That's the theory.  In practice, the child processes fail to close the main socket after receiving a graceful restart -- they keep the main socket open as well as the worker sockets that are actually doing the work.  The fix that I'm trying is to close all the listeners' sockets when the listener thread exits.  This seems to work, but I need to do some more testing before submitting diffs.	Any luck with the testing? Yes -- it worked well.  I'm no longer working for the company, though.  I'll get someone to send me  the diffs so I can post them. Here are the diffs from .48.

28174	null	CLOSED		Rolf Sponsel	1080956760000	1081633963000		Optionally allow specifying an URL as the argument to directive ServerAdmin. The directive 'ServerAdmin' today allows you to specify an email address whereto problems with the server should/could be emailed. This address is displayed in various places, e.g. on server generated pages, such as error documents.  Considering the widely mis-use of email addresses, collected by harvesting the internet in various ways, for e.g. mass-mailing, spamming, etc, I would like to have the possibility to optionally specify an URL instead of an email address that should be displayed instead. E.g. 'https://somedomain.name/contact', instead of 'contact@somedomain.name', which for example could present a mail form that the user could fill in. Thus there would be no need to expose an email address for this purpose. Of course, such an URL should ideally point to another server, because this server might present the errror response page (showing that  'serveradmin' url due to not being able to process such a form. But that decision should of course be left to the administrator to decide on.  I can, almost, achive this already with todays implementation (Apache 2.0.49) by specifying an URL to the 'ServerAdmin' directive, but such an URL will automatically get the 'mailto://' protocol prefix prepended, e.g. in customized error responses.  Therefore I'd like to suggest the following implementation, and thereby retaining backward compatibility; whenever a URL is given as the argument to the 'ServerAdmin' directive the argument should be presented to the user as specified (or at least constitute the 'href' of a link presented to the user, i think it's someting like webmaster, or so today). If the argument is NOT an URL then it should be assumed it's an email address - just as today. In this way one is allowed to explicitly specify 'mailto://admin@domain.name', as an alternative to the implicit 'admin@domain.name' too (if one would prefere).  This feature could help to reduce the amount of unsolicited emails sent to the otherwise exposed email address, and thereby hopefully allow the administrator(?) to focus on the important issues/emails instead of wading through all the junk. This kind of 'redirection', instead of using email addrsses, is becoming more an more popular for use in SSL server certificates too.  Best Regards, Rolf Sponsel	Hmmm... Why don't you just use ErrorDocument to customize the error responses.  That way you can have whatever you want.  The ServerAdmin should really be used only as a fallback when all else has failed.  And in that case, giving a URL (especially if it is on the same server) could be a big mistake.  But the real argument here is why add complexity when there is already a way to accomplish what you want? That is all fine - as long as - the only place where ServerAdmin is used/shown on a page is on the customized error pages AND does not use it for anything else, neither now nor in the future.  If this is NOT the case, IMHO this would be a minor, but useful, modification. It only requires that the argument to 'ServerAdmin' is checked for whether it's an URL, i.e. contains a string sequence '://'; otherwise the argument is prepended with that same 'mailto://' prefix as today. Not much of complexity it seems to me - is there?  Well, as I mentioned, one point of the ServerAdmin is to have a contact if all else fails.  Using a webpage for that sounds like a bad idea. ie: 500 server error, please see this other page, which also generates a 500 server error. What can I say?  I think you need to re-read my initial posting one more time. No offence please!  As I wrote in my initial posting:  '... Thus there would be no need to expose an email address for this purpose. Of course, such an URL should ideally point to another server, because this server might present the errror response page (showing that 'serveradmin' url due to not being able to process such a form. But that decision should of course be left to the administrator to decide on.'  I think your 'last post' doesn't present anything new in addition to what already has been pointed out before - right?  I accepting new ideas and suggestions from others, then fine. Then I don't have to waste my time. There are a lot of other software projects that welcome my contributions and ideas.  I have suggested this new feature due to having identified it's usefulness, and becuse it would be useful to me, it might(!?) be useful to others to.     Calm down a little Rolf.  I thought we were discussing the merits of the idea.  If I thought it was a hopeless idea, I would have closed the bug report.  Personally, I don't see a big benefit from this, and I do think it would be too tempting for people to put a URL on the same server.  But some of the developers may disagree.  Of course, ideas are much likely to be acted upon if they come with patches. To come to an end: I've the changed the two lines of code ;-) I'm happy to see that it didn't require any major changes to accomplish. I hope this will be useful to others too.  Thank You!

I had a quick glance through the code and  it reads like the regular expression library doesn't like this and regards it  as an error (i note solaris egrep errors, perl thinks its ok). The problem is  that this error is not reported to the user so the configuration appears to be  ok when the process is started. I think this is both confused to the naive  configuration creator and potentially dangerous if the Location block contains  some critical (say, security-related) directives.  It looks like the (handful of) ap_pregcomp calls in http_core.c do not check  for a NULL return code that would indicate a failed compilation. So this affects Location ~, LocationMatch, Directory ~, DirectoryMatch, Files ~,  FilesMatch.  Perhaps this problem exists in apache 2.0 as well? And maybe other areas of  apache 1.3 (not mod_alias, just had a look there!).	Thanks. Indeed it exists also in 2.x (even in more places). It's fixed now in 2.1 and proposed for backport into the stable branches.  Thanks for the report and thanks for using Apache. The fix will be in the next stable versions. (1.3.32 and 2.0.50).

None of Mozilla 1.5, Mozilla 1.6, and Konqueror 3.1.3 (which to my knowledge is not Gecko based and thus makes me believe that this actually is an error in Apache) do render '&excl;' as '!'. See TITLE of spanish (es) translations.   Is '&excl;' really an acknowledged name for representing a '!' (i.e. &#033;)?  Other languages use the exclamation mark '!' explicitly in their translations, e.g. german, french, swedish, etc.  Therefore an explicit exclamation mark '!' should be fine for spanish too.  Best Regards, Rolf Sponsel	Thanks :-)  &excl; is not defined by the W3C, so I've just replaced it by !. As we dealing with these things; there is actually another related issue.  I'm not sure if it's a Mozilla only thingie though, or if it's a general one. Theses spanish sentences - of course - use have the inverted exclamationmark (i.e. an '!' upside down), in these files represented by '&iexcl;'. Although this probably generally does work when used in web-pages rendered with standard compliant browsers; this does not work, i.e. it gets rendered litterally as '&iexcl;', when used in the <TITLE> - at least not for Mozilla. Would that be a bug in the implementation of the standard in Mozilla or another oversight (in Apache)?  Best Regards, Rolf Sponsel   Ps. Pardon me re-opening an already fixed bug, but I thought it was that related that I didn't wan't to file a separate report for it. Ds.  No problem. Still an error at our side :-(. We encoded the title again. Fixed in CVS now.  Thanks again.			Andr?? Malo	Rolf Sponsel

I e.g. have the following case:  /mnt/disk0/www.server1/<lots of virtual servers>.conf /mnt/disk0/www.server2/<lots of virtual servers>.conf  /virtual/www.server1 --- symbolic link --> /mnt/disk0/www.server1/ /virtual/www.server2 --- symbolic link --> /mnt/disk0/www.server2/  If I put  Include /mnt/disk0/www.server1/*.conf  into httpd.conf, it works. If I put  Include /virtual/www.server1/*.conf  into httpd.conf, it works not. In the strace of the httpd process, it is visible that apache tests, whether the /virtual/www.server1 reference is a directory but gets an error and halts.   Apache should test, whether an include reference is a symbolic link and if yes,  test its target to be a directory.	That is by intention in order to avoid infinite loops. It just needs to be better documented. Sorry to bother you, but IMHO this is still a bug.  We e.g. have a scenario where this include link points to an NFS mounted directory which can change due to failover reasons. This is how I found the problem. Basically I have a Include '/virtual/foo/*.conf' and the foo can be dynamically change doing a failover and a httpd restart. Our current solution rewrites the config files using sed and is awkward at best (pun intended).  Can we have an IncludeFollowLinksYesIveReadTheManualAndKnowAboutPossibleLoops directive? :-)  (Would you accept patches?)  For content we have 'FollowSymLinks'.Why not the same thing for the configuration?  I've finally found a way to stop include directive recursion (by using the pool context). So I no longer see a need for the symlink stopper at all, hence I'm going to patch it out. (just replacing ap_is_rdirectory with ap_is_directory in ap_process_resource_config and process_resource_config_nofnmatch).  The recursion stopper is currently in 2.1 and proposed for backport into 2.0. Thanks a lot! This will really help me with our HA environments and future releases of the httpd. FYI: The fix will be in 2.0.51. *** Bug 31099 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Andr?? Malo	Henning Schmiedehausen

So I wonder if what you've seen is a config problem?  Regarding the confirmation on netware, we've had some relevant patches recently from the netware folks.  Perhaps you could check if you[anyone] still have a problem? I corrected my problem myself by replacing #ifdef HAVE_ZUTIL_H, but if i am  the only one with this 'problem', it doesnt matter. maybe it's a config problem with zlib :) I get the same error with 2.0.52 under the following circumstances:  I have the zlib-devel-1.1.4 package installed on my system (SuSE Linux 8.2). This comes with the file zutil.h installed in /usr/lib. Although this is a file considered internal to zlib, it is obviously used by some applications (like apache). This is probably the justification for it being installed.  Now, I want to use a newer zlib with my httpd. I installed zlib 1.2.1 myself in $HOME/gnu. The 'make install' in the zlib sources does not install zutil.h (as the zlib authors consider it internal to zlib)!   Now, if I configure apache with --with-z=$HOME/gnu, the apache configure script will find zlib.h under that path, but will find the preinstalled zutil.h from the old zlib 1.4.1 in /usr/include !! This mix will lead to the compile error.  I am helping myself with manually copying the new zutil.h to $HOME/gnu/include.  If apache really needs zutil.h, the configure script should only look for it under the path given with --with-z, if that has been passed.  The real solution though is probably not to use zutil.h at all.

That definitely makes the world go round!  I just found that Apache, both 1 and 2, does not support files that are larger than 2GB.  Apache 2 does support it but only on (truly) 64-bit systems.  On such systems (I would even say majority thereof) where large files are supported (off_t is 64-bit) but size_t is limited to 32-bit, it does not work.  I browse the source and found that while apr_off_t is correctly used APR-wise, many calculations that contain apr_size_t variables led to incorrect values.  The quick & dirty proof-of-concept patch below does fix the problem.  Tested OK on FreeBSD 4, Mac OS X v10.3.  Compiled on Linux kernel 2.4.9 but rerurns 400 with log entry '[client 127.0.0.1] (75)Value too large for defined data type: access to /dvd.dmg failed'  As I said this is way too quick and dirty and I would appreciate if you guys fix that more properly and elegantly.  It may sound ridiculous to handle such large files but I happen to be a member of Ring Server Project which hosts one of the most famous open source distribution and there appears DVD images that get influenced.  Thank you in advance for your attention and support.

Dan the Truncated Man    Interesting.  That's a bug, but I can't reproduce it with HEAD on a 32-bit Linux using apr_off_t = off64_t, apr_size_t = size_t.  $ HEAD http://localhost:8900/big/bigfile | grep Content-Length Content-Length: 3145728000  so it's something more subtle.  Does the correct file size get logged to access_log if you GET the file?  Does autoindex show the correct size for the file in a directory listing? BTW, your HEAD test was with 2.0, I presume.  1.3 uses long rather than off_t for file sizes everywhere, so you're always limited by sizeof(long) in 1.3 even if sizeof(off_t) == 64. > $ HEAD http://localhost:8900/big/bigfile | grep Content-Length > Content-Length: 3145728000  I don't think it's big enough.  It's definitely larger than MAX_INT but well within UMAX_INT, which nicely fits in 32-bit.  3145728000 = 0xbb80_0000 < 0xffff_ffff  FYI to make large files quickly (and sparsely), you can go like    perl -e 'truncate shift, shift' file size  or    truncate -s size file  if your platform has trucate(1).  > BTW, your HEAD test was with 2.0, I presume.

We already have learned that forcibily making apr_size_t 64-bit off-t fixes the problem (in some platforms).  Oh, I have chenged the summery from '2GB' to '4GB' to be more precise.  > it would be great if you could debug it  Yikes.  I know HOW it went wrong but WHERE to fix is another problem.  Since it is size-related, that may even lead to changes in *.h, meaning API changes and that'way too much for me.    > i.e. work out if apr_stat() is determining the size correctly,  > and work on up...  That's not the only problem.  Anywhere apr_off_t is used in conjunction w/ apr_size_t are vulnerable.  i.e apr_bucket_read().  Dan the Apache *User* (and love to stay that way)   In Mac OS X, I later found that while Content-Length: header was correct w/ the previous patch, the actual file transfer gets trucated.  The following patch to emulate_sendfile() in server/core.c fixes that (YOU STILL NEED MY PREVIOUS PATCH).   I wonder why FreeBSD did work. Maybe because it was tested w/ truncated (sparse) file.  There on Mac OS X I have used the actual DVD image file for testing uI also applied byte-to-byte exhaustive file comparison as well as md5 sum to make sure the transferred file is identical to the original.  That explains reason why my patch did not quite work on Linux.  On Linux APR_HAS_SENDFILE is set and emulate_sendfile() is never used.

This will make it easier to write a config file for modules while have the core .c named something else (ie. sapi_apache2.c).	Agreed. This disturbes me all the time, too :-) I see several ways of solving this issue. 1) Create an Ifsymbol directive which is analogous to IfModule except it searches mod_so's internal dynamically loaded modules (moduleinfo structs). 2) Similar to 1 and have IfModule call a function in mod_so (via an optional function) to search mod_so's internal list of dynamically loaded modules. 3) Alter the STANDARD20_MODULE_STUFF macro to take one paramter which is the *filename* to register.. (ie.. for sapi_apache2.c sepcify mod_php4.so instead) This can be setup as a NAMED macro and have the standard one call the NAMED with __FILE__ to retain backword compatability. 4) provide an function to be called by a modules register_hook function to register alternate names and have the ap_find_linked_module search this list as well.

When logging the HTTP traffic I noticed that my HTTP status headers were being truncated.  Ex:  HTTP/1.1 200 O     instead of   HTTP/1.1 200 OK HTTP/1.1 302 Obje  instead of   HTTP/1.1 302 Object Moved HTTP/1.1 401 Acce  instead of   HTTP/1.1 401 Access Denied  I dug through the code and found a couple of problems with send_response_header in mod_isapi.c.  On line line 679 I made the following change:  statlen = toklen; // Instead of statlen -= tokenlen;  That left me with all of my headers truncated by one character.  After taking a look at line 685 I noticed a call was made to apr_cpystrn which assumes a null terminated string.  The call on 685 uses statlen and stat isn't null terminated.  So, changing it to  apr_cpystrn(newstat + 8, stat, statlen + 1); // Instead of apr_cpystrn(newstat + 8, stat, statlen);  Fixes the second problem.  All my status headers come through correctly with both changes in place.	apr_cpystrn takes a buffer length and must null terminate, your patch is quite correct.  thank you!  applied with commit 416288 Will Rowe has posted a zipfile containing compiled mod_isapi modules which include the patch correcting this bug (for use with 2.0.58 and 2.2.2), for testing purposes.

That's useful for us, for example, since globally Indexes are disabled, but if someone wishes to, he can enable Indexes for his web page (and subdirectories) or whatever, while we don't want to let people change other options.  This patch might not be fully complete or up to the Apache conventions, but I tried to write it as clean as possible given the time I have.  Please tell me if there are problems with it.  In the patch there is also very short documentation for this option.  I only tested, with version 2.0.49, on FreeBSD 4.9, that without that option the default (previous) behaviour is still used (All), and that specifying it has the desired effect of only allowing those options to be overridden.  Perhaps there are other things to test with it.  I'd be glad to have this patch (or a variant of it) integrated, to save us from further patching of new versions, and so it might be useful to others as well.	The URL was bad, I fixed it now.  Created an attachment (id=11721) Patch to add AllowOverrideOpts directive  Created an attachment (id=11722) Adds AllowOverrideOpts against 2.1-CVS  +1 - Tested w/ the patch for 2.1 and a cursory code review.  Only issue I see is the naming of the directive. AllowOrderrideOpts vs AllowOverrideOptions vs SomthingMuchShorterPlease. Without a closer look at the patch for now ... What about not to introduce a new directive, but extending AllowOverride, like  AllowOverride Options=Indexes,MultiViews  ? That (AllowOverride Options=) is a possibility too, shouldn't be too difficult to change it to work this way.  I'm not sure what's better, though...  It is after all quite a different context (specific to one directive, different function checking it...), so perhaps that would mean complicating AllowOverride a bit too much for specifics.  If that's preferred, I could (am willing to) modify the patch to work this way.  Created an attachment (id=12022) Patch for httpd 2.0.50 with syntax AllowOverride Options=  Slightly modified patch Commited to 2.1 CVS.  Thanks for helping with Apache,  -Paul Querna			Andr??

29318	null	CLOSED		David Greenaway	1086084360000	1086096103000		Apache 2.0.49 / mod_deflate and flushing CGI script causes huge memory consumption The following Perl CGI script causes the Apache worker process to consume huge amounts of memory (up to 650M for a page about 100k in size.) if the 'SetOutputFilter DEFLATE' is used.  --- script start --- #!/usr/bin/perl  print 'Content-Type: text/plain/n/n';  $| = 1; # flush output  for (my $i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {         print 'moo/n'; } --- script end ---  By commenting out the line 'flush output' and trying again, the page is served without any problems. Removing 'SetOutputFilter DEFLATE' also allows the page to be served without any trouble.  Changing the values of 'DeflateMemLevel', 'DeflateCompressionLevel' and 'DeflateBufferSize' do not affect the behaviour. However, if 'DeflateWindowSize' is <= 7, the problem goes away. At the value 8, the problem appears randomly (approximately one in two requests.) As the value increases, the probability of the process 'blowing up' increases. At a value of 15, the apache worker process always appears to blow up.  The script is being run with 'cgi-script', and not mod_perl. The same symptoms are experienced if the perl script is replaced with an identical compiled C program:  --- script start --- #include <stdio.h>  int main(void) {         int i;         printf('Content-Type: text/plain/n/n');         for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {                 printf('moo/n');                 fflush(stdout); /* flush output */         }          return 0; } --- end start ---	Thanks for the report.  Fixed on HEAD:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/filters/mod_deflate.c?r1=1.48&r2=1.49  and backport which does the same for 2.0:  http://cvs.apache.org/~jorton/ap_deflate.diff  This should prevent the massive memory consumption with large responses regardless of DeflateWindowSize setting. Confirmed fixed.  Thanks Joe! :)			David Greenaway	Joe Orton

It should say that the PCRE library is used, and a link to documentation of it. Eg. http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt or to Perl documentation (which might be better).  Additionally, it might not hurt to have a See Also link to something like 'Regular Expressions in Apache' for applicable directives, because I fear that few people would think of looking in the 'right' place.	I like the 'See Also' reference.   Alternatively, we could revise the description for *Match directives in the Core Features document. For example, we could modify the <LocationMatch> as follows: -- Description: Applies the enclosed directives only to perl-compatible regular expression matching URL's --  I also have a suggestion for the 'Configuration Sections' document: (under 'Wildcards and Regular Expression') -- If even more flexible matching is required, each container has a perl-compatible regular-expression (regex) counterpart --  This brings the perl-compatible statement to the first occurance of the words 'regular expression', which will make it stand out more.   A link here to the PCRE library would be more obvious than a link to the glossary.  I've fixed the directive-dict to say 'Perl-compatible' and to reference the glossary.  Changing every directive that uses a regular expression would be a major undertaking.

29740	null	RESOLVED		Max Bowsher	1087919400000	1107477578000		--with-apr=/usr is broken Configuring with --with-apr=/usr usually fails. This is because:  The generated exports.c #includes all *.h files found in <apr-prefix>/include If <apr-prefix> == /usr , then this means /usr/include/*.h !!!  On most systems, it's quite likely that some of these are C++ headers, or have conflicting definitions, so breaking the build.  The solution is to only include apr and apr-util headers from the apr and apr-util include directories. This is easy to do, as apr and apr-util headers follow a consistent naming scheme.  Here is a patch, to include only apr.h, apu.h, apr_*.h, and apu_*.h from the apr and apr-util include directories.  It is against httpd-2.0.49 (current release), but it applies without conflict to  current 2.0-HEAD and 2.1-HEAD.  --- httpd-2.0.49/server/Makefile.in.orig 2004-06-21 01:00:42.308012800 +0100 +++ httpd-2.0.49/server/Makefile.in 2004-06-21 01:14:25.131174400 +0100 @@ -31,7 +31,8 @@    util.lo: test_char.h   -EXPORT_DIRS = $(top_srcdir)/include $(top_srcdir)/os/$(OS_DIR) $(APR_INCLUDEDIR) $(APU_INCLUDEDIR) $(top_srcdir)/modules/http +EXPORT_DIRS = $(top_srcdir)/include $(top_srcdir)/os/$(OS_DIR) $(top_srcdir)/modules/http +EXPORT_DIRS_APR = $(APR_INCLUDEDIR) $(APU_INCLUDEDIR)    # If export_files is a dependency here, but we remove it during this stage,  # when exports.c is generated, make will not detect that export_files is no @@ -58,6 +59,10 @@   for dir in $(EXPORT_DIRS); do /       ls $$dir/*.h >> $$tmp; /   done; / + for dir in $(EXPORT_DIRS_APR); do / +     ls $$dir/ap[ru].h >> $$tmp 2>/dev/null; / +     ls $$dir/ap[ru]_*.h >> $$tmp 2>/dev/null; / + done; /   sort -u $$tmp > $@; /   rm -f $$tmp	Created an attachment (id=11910) The same patch as inline, but attached to avoid line-wrapping  We have had similar problems trying to build APR, APU, and then HTTPD all by themselves, in Source Mage GNU/Linux. Our patches are here:  http://codex.sourcemage.org/test/libs/apr/build.diff http://codex.sourcemage.org/test/libs/apr-util/build.diff most reasonable places have the APR headers installed to /usr/include/apr-{0,1} don't they? Replying to Paul Querna above:  Installing to <prefix>/include is the default in apr. For httpd to be incompatible with the default build and install of apr seems rather wrong to me.  Besides, just because the bug won't affect some environments doesn't mean it shouldn't be fixed, especially when fixing it only requires a tiny patch, which I have already written and attached to the bug. Replying to Sergey A. Lipnevich above:  AFAICS your patches are about an entirely unrelated issue. APR must be able to find it's headers if they are installed in /usr/include or in /usr/include/apr-{0,1}, which is where APR v1.0 seems to want to put them.

29755	null	RESOLVED		Sami J. M??kinen	1087984140000	1112828682000		mod_usertrack should use err_headers_out In short, we are running several large websites that have banner advertisements. A friendly way to serve banners is to configure the IMG SRC tags so that they refer to an apache server using mod_usertrack and mod_rewrite. This way, we get a decently reliable visitor log and banner exposure log. The redirect points to the 'real' image server that gives long expire times so that the browser does not have to download each banner every time, but we still get nice logs for our advertisers.  The problem that we ran into, is that whenever you make a redirect from mod_rewrite, the fixups hooks stop and mod_usertrack is never called. So we don't get cookies logged when http status is 302.  I fixed this quite simply:  in mod_usertrack, modify the function  --- 8< --- static void register_hooks(apr_pool_t *p) {     ap_hook_fixups(spot_cookie,NULL,NULL,APR_HOOK_MIDDLE); } --- 8< ---  to be  --- 8< --- static void register_hooks(apr_pool_t *p) {     ap_hook_fixups(spot_cookie,NULL,NULL,APR_HOOK_FIRST); } --- 8< ---  ...and make sure that mod_usertrack is loaded before mod_rewrite, if using dynamic modules. We use RHEL3ES, and the apache distributed by Red Hat is using dynamic modules for almost everything.  I would be very pleased if stock apache's mod_usertrack would use APR_HOOK_FIRST in the future. I don't think this small but important modification would break anything. :-o  P.S.  request.c says  AP_IMPLEMENT_HOOK_RUN_ALL(int,fixups,                           (request_rec *r), (r), OK, DECLINED)  it took some time for me to find out that 'RUN_ALL' here does not mean 'run all hooks in any case'. It means actually 'run every hook until one of them does not return DECLINED or OK'. Sheesh.	Changed in 2.1 CVS.  Thanks for using Apache! Uh, the following hit us:  http://ken.coar.org/burrow/index?entry=511  in short, mod_usertrack really should set the cookie header in err_headers_out, NOT headers_out.  The headers in headers_out will not get sent if the request ends in a redirect. Sigh.  Furthermore, register_hooks should look like this:  static void register_hooks(apr_pool_t *p) {     /* fixup before mod_proxy, so that the proxied url will not      * be escaped accidentally by our fixup.      */     static const char * const aszSucc[]={ 'mod_rewrite.c', 'mod_proxy.c',                                           'mod_alias.c', NULL };     ap_hook_fixups(spot_cookie, NULL, aszSucc, APR_HOOK_FIRST); } Sigh.

For many months, using different versions of Apache 2.0.x from Debian testing, we have been experiencing what can only be described as serious memory leaks when using mod_proxy and/or mod_rewrite to reverse  proxy backend web servers. I am using MPM prefork.  I have been able to troubleshoot this problem using network captures etc. on  our production machines and I believe I can reproduce this problem on a test system.  To reproduce this, I used an apache 1.3.29 on port 3000 on the localhost used as the backend server. In our live environment, this is on a different machine. Apache 2 listens on port 80 and is used as a reverse proxy for the server on port 3000.  For the Apache1.3, I have /usr/lib/cgi-bin/do-post:  #!/usr/bin/perl print 'Content-type: text/plain/n/n'; for ($t=0; $t<400000; ++$t) {         print 'o'x99; print '/n' }  Which essentially returns about 40Mb of data.  For the Apache2 config, I have the following virtual host:  <VirtualHost *>         ServerName www.test.local         RewriteEngine On         ProxyRequests On         ProxyPreserveHost Off         RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}      ^www/.test/.local$         RewriteRule ^/(.*)            http://localhost:3000/$1     [P,L] </VirtualHost>  Now, the following type of request:  sneppef@xbox:~$ telnet localhost 80 > /tmp/t POST /cgi-bin/do-post HTTP/1.1 Host: www.test.local Range: bytes=20000000-35000000  suddenly bumps the memory use of an apache child process, in this case to about 80Mb on my system, and this doesn't seem to get freed  afterwards.  This is a close as I can simulate this on a test environment at this moment. Things are even more dramatic on our production systems.

Surely if the backend server only returns about 38Mb of data and Apache2 child process shouldn't consume 150Mb :-/  I hope this helps... If you need any other info, let me know, as I have been able to reproduce this every time. I have tagged this as a major issue, since bug 23567 seems to be considered critical. I hope I am not exagerating, as this is my first bugreport on Apache. Do keep up the excellent work!  Regards	Yes, this is a problem with the byterange filter in 2.0, it will buffer the entire response in memory.  I am just wondering if there is currently *any* workaround for this ? A directive that disables byterange support ? Because, isn't this a serious security issue in itself ? It means any user that can send http requests to an apache proxy can DoS it by sending even a limited number of specially crafted requests that download some large files somewhere... You can DoS any HTTP server very easy. One could say, that's part of the protocol ;-)  Anyway,  RequestHeader unset Range  or somehting like this should work for you. Don't forget  Header unset Accept-Ranges  so the server isn't telling porkies about its capabilities I appear to be experiencing a similar problem when my users submit files to the server.  I've noticed that a submitted assignment (POST), which has an attached word document, appears to cause one of the apache processes to inflate to between 300 - 750 megabytes in size.  This does not appear to be equal to the size of the attachment. I hunted down the problem, it was an error in a purchased PHP script that loaded the entire contents of our of our db tables into memory (which is now approaching the 800 megabytes threshhold).  However, when the script terminated that memory was not being released by Apache 2.0.51. The byterange filter memory consumption issue is now fixed for 2.1.5.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=188797&view=rev Created an attachment (id=16102) Byterange patch for Apache 2.0.x  I hope Joe won't mind if I post a version of the patch which he modified to work with the Apache 2.0.x branch.  Thanks, Joe! Now merged for 2.0.55.  Thanks for the report.  I'm not sure that this has been fixed, I've downloaded the patch and have it applied yet, it still runs amuck.  I checked on my server this morning, and there sat a process in apache holding onto 635MB of data.  Maybe this bug is occuring somewhere else.  I am in no way capable of tracking that down, but I do know it's still occuring. 			Andr?? Malo	Brady Bowen	Filip Sneppe	Joe Orton	Nick Kew	Tyler	dswhite42@yahoo.com
29964	null	CLOSED		Francis Wai	1089244200000	1092230755000		non-terminating i/o I'm seeing a non-terminating loop in ssl_io_input_getline().  We used a 3rd party tool to send a request to our Apache server. The tool tried  to present an expired certificate to a SSL enabled vhost and Apache correctly  refused the correction. But, it set Apache to spin out of control.  I'm a complete outsider of the Apache/mod_ssl code. But this is what I found.  As mentioned, Apache did shutdown the filter's SSL connection. However, it  continued to read in GETLINE/blocking mode the rest of the request. Here comes  the problem. ssl_io_input_getline() calls ssl_io_input_read() to read to a LF  or the max. of the buffer can handle, whichever comes first. But,  ssl_io_input_read() realizes the filter's SSL connection has been shutdown, it  returns with the last known status of the BIO which was created to read from  this SSL connection. It also set the returned length to 0. Unfortunately, the  caller get APR_SUCCESS return code and because the returned length is 0, the  remaining buffer length does not get changed at all.   Because the return code is always APR_SUCCESS and because the returned length  is always 0 and the buffer is not full, ssl_io_input_getline() keeps calling  ssl_io_input_read(). It goes on forever!	Created an attachment (id=12060) ssl_io_input_read fix  Thanks for the report and analysis.  Can you try the patch attached above?  Thanks for the quick response.  We thought about this before I submitted the bug report. We thought APR_EOF or  APR_EGENERAL or in fact any return code other than APR_SUCCESS would have been  sufficient to prevent Apache from spinning out of control.  We could not decide on either, however. We are not super familiar with the  Apache/mod_ssl code and, more important, this is the most exercised part of  the server as far as we're concerned. It is important that the return code  does what it is supposed to do _and_ does not cause any un-expected side- effect.  APR_ECONNRESET, APR_EGENERAL or APR_EOF would all be reasonable choices.  Doing any of these would clearly be better than the status quo; opt for APR_EGENERAL to be conservative.  I couldn't reproduce the issue here from in brief attempt, so if you could confirm that the patch does fix the issue that would be helpful.  We patched Apache as suggested and it does fix the problem. We're in the  process of conducting more thorough tests and if anything unexpected crops up,  I'll report here.  Thanks for the response.  The fix checked in is slightly different:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_io.c?r1=1.124&r2=1.125  this will be proposed for backport for the next 2.0 release.  This issue has been assigned CVE CAN-2004-0748.			Francis Wai	Joe Orton
30033	null	RESOLVED		Dr. Martin Luckow	1089541260000	1150958602000		mod_isapi: WriteClient not able to write HTTP-Headers To get more control over the HTTP-Header i send it via WriteClient (and not via  ServerSupportFunction). This works fine under IIS but under Apache WriteClient  fails and GetLastError() returns 87 (invalid parameter).	I've no idea who works on mod_isapi, but I think this bug report really needs an example that demonstrates the problem.  From the description, I'd have thought you could construct a HelloWorld-sized example? Sample:  DWORD WINAPI HttpExtensionProc(LPEXTENSION_CONTROL_BLOCK ecb) {   char* buffer = 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK/r/nDate: Sun, 11 Jul 2004 09:10:58  GMT/r/nContent-length: 0/r/n/r/n';   unsigned long bufferSize = strlen(buffer);    if (!ecb->WriteClient(ecb->ConnID,buffer,&bufferSize,HSE_IO_SYNC)) {     return HSE_STATUS_ERROR;   }; // if   return HSE_STATUS_SUCCESS_AND_KEEP_CONN; };  IIS: WriteClient works, the header is 'nph-'sent. Apache: WriteClient fails. I had a look at the code in mod_isapi.c, I changed line 687 from  apr_cpystrn(newstat + 8, stat, statlen + 1); to apr_cpystrn(newstat + 8, stat, statlen);  and that seemed to fix the problem for me. For the example above Apache would try to process the header line 'Status: 200 OK/r/nD', and points out that 'D' is not a valid header. I don't think this is actually the problem.   I use WriteClient to dump out a complete HTTP response which includes header  and body in the first chunk that gets passed to WriteClient. The header might  look like this:  <pre> HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 3042  ... some HTML text goes here. </pre>  This works perfect with IIS, but not with Apache. I get the same 87 error as  mentioned above. There's definitely more going on here than just an extra  character in the header block... Created an attachment (id=18374) Patch to not clobber the ISAPI's response code.  I've attached a patch to 2.2.2's mod_isapi.c which should correct this behavior. I've run it against a suite of ISAPI extensions, all of which give their correct responses as far as I can tell.  What seems to be the issue is that ap_scan_script_header_err_strs likes to return 0 (or some other value which is not the HTTP status). The current mod_isapi sticks this result in as the HTTP status. Needless to say, this is quite unexpected. Since mod_isapi's send_response_header already gets the correct value, there's no reason that I can see to second-guess it.  If someone can review this trivial patch for sanity, I'd appreciate it. I can't find any breakage, but I assume that someone did that for a reason. Created an attachment (id=18375) More correct patch, cribbed from mod_cgi  On the advice of wrowe, I've attached a more correct patch which cribs from mod_cgi. As a rule, we probably don't want to use the return from ap_scan_script_header_err_strs. But if it's non-zero, we should.  The last patch neglected a case, as well. This one should catch everything.  Again, I ran it through its paces and was able to get a variety of responses. See bug 16637 for an interrelated issue. Created an attachment (id=18392) Complete logic overhaul for send_response_header  This updated patch completely replaces the HTTP response status logic in send_response_header. It likely should correct the issue mentioned in bug 16637 as well.    This looks great.  Please review trunk, I've refactored this a bit to make   the interrelations between r->status and dwStatus a bit clearer.     I hate when I can't track this stuff down.  The commit to trunk which is   expected to resolve this is 416272 Will Rowe has posted a zipfile containing compiled mod_isapi modules which include the patch correcting this bug (for use with 2.0.58 and 2.2.2), for testing purposes. It is available at:  http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mod_isapi-416293.zip  You may read his full email to the dev@httpd.apache.org list here:  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=115206683718140&w=2  If you test this version of mod_isapi, please post your feedback to the dev@httpd.apache.org list. Your feedback will help ensure that there are no regressions or other issues in this version of mod_isapi.			Dr. Martin Luckow	John Taylor	Matt Lewandowsky	Nick Kew	Rick Strahl	Will Rowe

Steps to Reproduce:  1) Set up an IIS server using SSL and running eRoom 6.  2) Add the following directives to httpd.conf:  Listen 47290 SSLProxyEngine on RewriteEngine on RewriteRule /(.*) https://some.eroom6.iis.server.com/$1 [P]  3) Visit a URL similar to the following:  http://reverse.proxy.com:47290/eRoomASP/CookieTest.asp?facility=facility&URL=%2FeRoom%2FFacility%2FRoom%2F0_4242  If that doesn't cause the segfault, click around for a while.  (Yes, reverse proxying from non-SSL to SSL is not a good idea, but it keeps the example simpler.)

30190	null	RESOLVED		Sylvain Beucler	1090265040000	1188273632000		PNG icons are not transparent I changed Savannah's mod_autoindex configuration to use PNGs /icons (no GIFs at gnu.org), and noticed that the PNG files do not have a transparent background. I used this quick script to convert them well from GIFs:  for i in *.png; do giftopnm --alphaout $i.msk ${i%png}gif | pnmtopng -alpha $i.msk > $i; rm -f $i.msk; done  (the script iterates on png's because the animation gif should not be taken into account).	Now I have a bugzilla account I'm actually doing something about this.  This bites me frequently, hence the vote.  If the pnm tools aren't installed, but gif2png is, then:  $ gif2png -tw *.gif small/*.gif | xargs gif2png -ghnrsO  Expected output from command-line is one stderr message from the first gif2png invocation, noting the animated GIF (which is the reason for doing things this way).  I see the problem, that there are just a few browsers that actually support transparent png images, resp. some browsers have real problems with them. Perhaps we should just put the conversion script snippets somewhere into the docs? The problem is that the PNGs are shipped at all without transparency.  Since the PNGs aren't actually used by default, can't they be fixed so that anyone who chooses to use them at least gets full PNGs which don't look so bad in mod_autoindex that they put people off using PNGs?  It looks as though MSIE is the one fly in the ointment:   http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngstatus.html but according to that, cells which aren't completely opaque are rendered as completely transparent; since the Apache images don't use blending but have pixels either transparent or with colour (AFAIK), for this purpose is there actually a problem?  I just checked with my fiancee's MSIE 6.0 and the few icons used in one of my mod_autoindex pages rendered just fine; that's with the transparent PNGs rendered by the example command-line which I gave.  In fact, I've just created a web-page using all the PNG icons (except those in small) and they _all_ rendered fine.  If anyone wants to test more widely, there seems to be a decent testbed at:   http://entropymine.com/jason/testbed/pngtrans/ but that covers a much more general case than the Apache icons, which require a much simpler subset of PNG rendering functionality. Created an attachment (id=13727) Transparent PNG icons  Transparent PNG icons, converted from the transparent GIFs from the 2.0.52 source distribution. Created an attachment (id=13728) Transparent PNG icons  New version with the small directory included Sorry for all the new comments, I'm unfamiliar with bugzilla.  I've attached a tarball of transparent PNG icons.  These were converted from the GIFs distributed with 2.0.52 using 'giftopng -O'.  They are slightly (a few bytes per icon) larger than the old, non-transparent ones, and as far as I can tell display just fine in all browsers (even IE).  Please consider moving these icons into CVS so they may one day be distributed.  I'm getting tired of having to convert the GIFs by hand every time I install a new version of Apache :)  Thanks I can indeed still reproduce it. I hope it can be fixed; as said the icons now display badly in *any* browser while that could be reduced to only some (by now already older) browers.  The following snippet when using ImageMagick solves it:  for i in *.png; do convert ${i%png}gif $i;done  Thanks. Come on guys, it's been 3 years and we've provided you three different ways to  fix this. Thanks for the ImageMagick pointer (although I had to resort to GraphicsMagick since ImageMagick was generating corrupt .png's).  Note I used the -quality 100 to avoid any lossy optimization. (In reply to comment #9)  Thanks, Will!  You are my PNG hero.			Andr?? Malo	Neale Pickett	Phil Pennock	Thijs Kinkhorst	Will Rowe

What is your setting for DefaultType ? Is it unset or text/plain?  I had a similar problem with mod_jk and mod_cache / mod_disk_cache. I would guess that they are related. See also http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30398. Here are my answers: 1. DefaultType is set to 'text/plain' 2. Images from cache also come out with 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8'  Looks like what you are describing in your issue is exactly the same thing, I wonder if I can try your patch to see if it will fix the problem. No, you cannot use my patch as I patched mod_jk to solve my problem. You need a patch for mod_disk_cache. But as I mentioned in 30398, I was not quite sure if this problem is a bug in mod_jk or mod_cache / mod_disk_cache (BTW: mod_mem_cache does not have this problem). After I read this report here I am quite sure that it is a bug in mod_disk_cache and that it should be fixed there. mod_disk_cache.c already contains the needed code in write_headers, but it is executed too late. So I just moved this piece of code and created an appropriate patch for this which I will attach.  I removed my patch from my mod_jk and added my patch to mod_disk_cache and my problem from 30398 remains silent. I hope that this patch will also solve your problem. A short feedback on your experience with the patch would be much appreciated.  BTW: If you have any problems with mod_cache storing Cookies unintentional, or with other weird HTTP header caching behaviour you may find the following links useful:  http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30399 http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30419  Created an attachment (id=12339) proposed solution patch to mod_disk_cache.c  I've tested this patch and it works perfectly.

Here's the example I'd like added (Let me know if I should edit and attach the html instead, I want to help :).  Using VirtualHost and mod_proxy together: We use ProxyPreserveHost because the secondary server should recieve requests with the desired hostname intact in case we're proxying multiple hostnames to a single machine.  Be careful if you've already used ProxyPass to set up a folder to the secondary server, that can conflict with  Server configuration <VirtualHost *:*>   ProxyPreserveHost On   ProxyPass / http://192.168.111.2/   ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.111.2/   ServerName bugzilla.mydomain.com   ServerAlias bugzilla.mydomain.com </VirtualHost>	Thanks.

30370	null	RESOLVED		Axel-Stephane Smorgrav	1091028120000	1188891651000		Pages cached in more than one cache remain stale although it is revalidated. On a reverse proxy, centuri, we have both disk cache and mem cache activated.  The memory cache is activated first and is only supposed to cache elements of  size smaller than 10,000 bytes. The disk cache takes care of anything not  cached by the memory cache.  Somehow, at one point a file of size smaller than 10,000 bytes ends up being  cached by the disk cache. Don't ask me why (maybe the mem cache was filled up  and the element ended up on disk?) - it's beyond the point. Eventually, the  file in disk cache ends up stale. At that point, when the element (style.css)  is requested, the disk cache responds that it is stale and a proxy request is  issued to the backend server. The fresh element ends up being cached in memory  since it is smaller than 10 KB, and the stale entry remains in the disk cache...  When the caches are queried, it seems like the disk cache is always queried  first.  The logs below should clearly show what happens. mod_disk_cache does not appear  to log the element as stale, but I know that the disk cache contains a stale  copy of styles.css because I looked it up in the file system. Removing the  element from the disk cache also removes the symptoms.  Please find below the log trace of two requests for the same element style.css  on the reverse proxy centuri:3080. The backend server is backend:7010. The two  requests are separated by some CRs.

This behaviour was observed on Sun Solaris 8, but from what I saw in the code,  there is no reason to think it would behave differently on other platforms.	Can you please try the mod_disk_cache that is part of 2.0.52 or CVS HEAD?  There have been many fixes for it recently. Though not sure if it is the same cause, I'm having exactly the same issue and  I think I have tracked down the bug. I've reviewed the code in latest snapshot  and believe this bug still exists both in 2.0 and 2.2 (I have verified it with  2.0 tree). Also, this could also be a bug in mod_mem_cache.c.  The cause of this bug is that cached entry never gets removed from cache  repository maintained by mod_*_cache. There's a issue in  cache_storage.c:cache_select_url method that incorrectly(?) handles cache- >stale_handle. Here's the code:    fresh = ap_cache_check_freshness(h, r);   if (!fresh) {     if (info && info->etag) {        ...        cache->stale_handle = h;     }     else if (info && info->lastmods) {       ...       cache->stale_handle = h;     }     return DECLINED;   }   ...   cache->handle = h;  As you can see, even when cache has expired, there's a case when cache- >stale_handle does not get set. Because of this, following part of the code in  mod_cache.c:cache_save_filter is never executed:    if (cache->stale_handle) {     if (r->status == HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED) {       ...     }     else {       /* Oh, well.  Toss it. */       cache->provider->remove_entity(cache->stale_handle);       /* Treat the request as if it wasn't conditional. */       cache->stale_handle = NULL;     }   }  So when cache->stale_handle is not set, above remove_entity is never called,  meaning (expired) cache remains in cache repository.  Now, because obsolete cache remains, following code in  mod_cache.c:cache_save_filter fails with mod_mem_cache:    /* no cache handle, create a new entity */   if (!cache->handle) {     rv = cache_create_entity(r, url, size);     ...   }    if (rv != OK) {     /* Caching layer declined the opportunity to cache the response */     ...  Looking into mod_mem_cache.c:create_entity, there's a following code:    tmp_obj = (cache_object_t *) cache_find(sconf->cache_cache, key);   ...   if (tmp_obj) {     /* This thread collided with another thread loading the same object      * into the cache at the same time. Defer to the other thread which      * is further along.      */     cleanup_cache_object(obj);     return DECLINED;   }  So mod_mem_cache.c:create_entity (incorrectly) returns a 'thread conflict'  error when obsolete cache remains in cache repository. And due to this return  code, mod_cache.c:cache_save_filter skips caching.  To fix (or workaround) this issue, cache_storage.c:cache_select_url can be  fixed as follows:    fresh = ap_cache_check_freshness(h, r);   if (!fresh) {     cache->stale_headers = apr_table_copy(r->pool, r->headers_in);     cache->stale_handle = h;      /* Make response into a conditional */     /* FIXME: What if the request is already conditional? */     if (info && info->etag) {       /* if we have a cached etag */       apr_table_set(r->headers_in, 'If-None-Match', info->etag);     }     else if (info && info->lastmods) {       /* if we have a cached Last-Modified header */       apr_table_set(r->headers_in, 'If-Modified-Since', info->lastmods);     }     return DECLINED;   }  Similar fix can be done with Apache 2.2 as well.  I'm now looking into caching behavior of mod_disk_cache.c, as unlike  mod_mem_cache.c, it seems it does not check for thread-level conflict. After all review is done, I'll send in a patch.  > Though not sure if it is the same cause, I'm having exactly the same issue ...  After reading first poster's message again, I guess my issue isn't exactly the  same issue. My issue is that mod_cache never refreshes cached entry once  initial cache expired.

I'm doing a reverse proxied configuration, and here's an excerpt from  httpd.conf:    <VirtualHost *:8080>    CacheEnable mem /    CacheIgnoreHeaders Set-Cookie    MCacheSize 65535    MCacheMaxObjectCount 8192    MCacheMaxObjectSize 65535     ProxyPass        / http://127.0.0.1/real/    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1/real/    ProxyPreserveHost On    ProxyTimeout 5   </VirtualHost>  And the content of hello.fphp is:    <?php   header('Expires: ' . date(DATE_RFC822, time() + 10));   print_r($_SERVER);   ?>  As you can see, this should expire in 10 seconds after cache is made, and it does work as expected. But it never gets cached after its first expiration, probably due to apache issue I posted above.  Thanks for the report. Please use httpd 2.2.x for caching since it contains many fixes and improvements since the days of the experimental cache module of 2.0.x.

The APR tmpfile interface should be used instead.  Is the APR tmpfile interface available in v0.9 of APR? Actually since this is just for a mutex, the right thing to do is to pass a NULL filename parameter to apr_global_mutex_create if no CacheFile is specified, rather than some random temporary filename. According to the APR docs for apr_global_mutex_create():  fname \tA file name to use if the lock mechanism requires one. This argument should always be provided. The lock code itself will determine if it should be used.  So the compiler claims tmpnam() is evil, but all the alternatives involve actually opening a file, which isn't what we need.  Does APR have a temp file creation function? Are the APR docs above about the argument always being provided correct, or is it really safe to pass NULL to this function on all platforms?  APR now has apr_file_mktemp():   http://docx.webperf.org/group__apr__file__io.html#ga50  I assume this does the right thing on the various platforms.  apr_file_mktemp() opens a file, apr_global_mutex_create() needs a filename, not an actual file.  Ideally apr_global_mutex_create() should be able to just accept NULL and internally use apr_file_mktemp(), rather than insisting on a temp file name from the calling application.  Regards, Graham -- It actually does do precisely that in all the Unix implementations.  Alternatively using a serverroot-relative filename 'logs/<something-unique>.<pid>' should work as well.

I noticed that mod_cache also stores cookies (or better the Set-Cookie header) with all the other End-to-end headers (see 13.5.1 RFC 2616). As I can see from the RFC this is required to be RFC 2616 compliant.  In my special case this is a problem because I try to use mod_cache to cache Tomcat generated jsps for performance reasons.  Currently I help myself by adding  apr_table_unset(headers_out, 'Set-Cookie');  to ap_cache_cacheable_hdrs_out. As this approach breaks RFC 2616 compliance I am sure that this approach will never be part of the official Apache code.  To prevent patching of future Apache versions I would like ask to if there is any chance that an additional configuration directive will be added to mod_cache that allows to define headers that should not be cached. Of course setting this directive in your configuration would break RFC 2616 compliance of mod_cache, so the default value for this directive should be empty or none.   Regards  R??diger Pl??m	Hi,  meanwhile I wrote a patch to mod_cache / mod_disk_cache / mod_mem_cache that introduces the new server config directive CacheStoreCookies. By default this directive is set to 'On' thus leaving everything as it currently behaves in 2.0.50. Setting CacheStoreCookies to 'Off' prevents the Set-Cookie headers from being stored by the cache. This way I can configure the behaviour that I need in my special case.  Regards  R??diger Pl??m Created an attachment (id=12295) CacheStoreCookies Patch  My patch has a little different implementation approach compared to the patch of 23687. Also the patch for the documentation is currently missing. I will add this when I find time or someone gets interested in my version of the patch. Created an attachment (id=12877) Patch against 2.0.51  Created an attachment (id=13097) More general approach patch against 2.0.52.  After a discussion on the developer list the new patch has a more general approach and replaces the previous CacheStoreCookies directive with the more general CacheIgnoreHeaders directive which allows to prevent arbitrary headers from being stored, not just cookies. CacheIgnoreHeaders is now in 2.1 and will be incorporated in a future release.  Thanks! Created an attachment (id=14434) Patch against 2.0.53 			Justin Erenkrantz	R??diger Pl??m
30464	null	CLOSED		R??diger Pl??m	1091624880000	1093615830000		SSL_ variables from mod_ssl not available for RewriteCond tests in mod_rewrite Hi,  1. Environment:  OS: Linux Apache: 2.0.50  2. Problem:  As I upgraded some Apache 1.3.x systems to Apache 2.0.50 I noticed that the SSL_ variables defined by mod_ssl are no longer available for checks with RewriteCond.  In Apache 1.3.x RewriteConds like the following delivered reasonable results:  RewriteCond %{SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE} !^[0-9][0-9][0-9]  On Apache 2.0.50 the input stays empty as the following excerpt from the RewriteLog (Level 9) shows:  92.168.2.4 - - [04/Aug/2004:11:57:06 +0200] [www.something.de/sid#8122700][rid# 818a1b0/initial] (4) RewriteCond: input='' pattern='!^[0-9][0-9][0-9]' => matche d  Even after adding SSLOptions +StdEnvVars and modifying the RewriteCond to  RewriteCond %{ENV:SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE} !^[0-9][0-9][0-9]  nothing changed. The input remains empty.  3. Analysis  The root cause for this problem is that mod_ssl writes its SSL_ variables to r->subprocess_env in its fixup handler (provided SSLOptions contains StdEnvVars), but all fixup handlers are executed after the translate_name handlers. On the other hand the evaluation of the rewrite rules happens in mod_rewrites translate_name handler, so the variables are not available at this point of time.  4. Solution proposal  I noticed that the documentation for mod_rewrite of Apache 2.1 points out a special prefix for the SSL_ variables named SSL: (like ENV: for environment variables). So the solution approach is to add a piece of code to lookup_variable in mod_rewrite.c that checks for variablenames that start with SSL: after the check for the variables which names start with ENV:. The mod_ssl function ssl_var_lookup can be used to get the values for the specific variables as it has been registered by mod_ssl with APR_REGISTER_OPTIONAL_FN in ssl_engine_vars.c. After that it would be possible to check the SSL_ variables in RewriteCond's via prefixing the variable name with SSL:. For example the following RewriteCond   RewriteCond %{SSL:SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE} !^[0-9][0-9][0-9]  would be a replacement for my old (Apache 1.3.x) RewriteCond  RewriteCond %{SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE} !^[0-9][0-9][0-9]  I wrote an appropriate patch for mod_rewrite which I tested on my environment. It worked as designed. I attach the patch.   Regards  R??diger Pl??m	Created an attachment (id=12327) Solution proposal patch  Currently my patch is missing the according patch of the mod_rewrite documentation. As my patch is a backport (even from the coding point of view as I compared my patch and an actual CVS snapshot of Apache 2.1) of the same functionality offered by Apache 2.1 I simply backported the according paragraph for the Apache 2.1 documentation of mod_rewrite.xml. So the contents of the documentation patch I will attach has been written by one of the Apache 2.1 mod_rewrite contributors / authors. Created an attachment (id=12515) Documentation patch  Thanks for the patch.  This has been proposed for backport to 2.0.  It can't be done by including mod_ssl.h, since that fails if mod_ssl is not enabled in 2.0, so the optional function declarations have to be duplicated. For references, the proposed patches are:  http://www.apache.org/~jorton/mod_rewrite-2.0-sslvar.diff http://www.apache.org/~jorton/mod_ssl-2.0-ishttps.diff Thanks for the feedback and the references. You are right it is not possible to include mod_ssl.h in Apache 2.0 without enabling it via configure. I did not notice that as I compile my Apache always with mod_ssl. So I included mod_ssl.h to avoid the duplication of the optional function declarations. It is nice to hear that this feature should be backported to Apache 2.0. Do you already know a release of Apache 2.0 in which this will be included? The backport requires votes from two additional developers, so it depends when people have time to review the changes. Now committed for 2.0.51. Thats very good news. Thanks.			Joe Orton	R??diger Pl??m

Following options were used: './configure' / '--with-mpm-worker' / '--enable-so' / '--enable-layout=Apache' / '--enable-mods-shared=most' / '--with-expat=/home/bozy/src/httpd-2.0.50/srclib/apr-util/xml/expat' / '--enable-static-support' / 'CC=xlc_r' / 'CFLAGS=-O2 -I/usr/local/include' / 'LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib' /  Note: I neded specifically '_r' compiler for Apache to build properly with  libdb-4.2, since Berkeley DB on AIX builds as multithreaded.  Everything compiled and built OK apart from some compiler warnings about  incorrect file suffixes on '.la' files (I guess these could be ignored). I made  an 'apachectl start' - everything started OK, error_log showing: [quote] [Thu Aug 05 13:20:40 2004] [notice] Apache/2.0.50 (Unix) PHP/5.0.0 DAV/2  configured -- resuming normal operations [unquote] When trying to telnet to port 80 of the server I get following: [quote] $ telnet powerpc 80   Trying...

I tried all thinkable  combinations of optimization flags during compile, unloaded nearly all modules  (including PHP5) etc. to no avail.  Finally (being almost sure nothing will change) I used 'cc_r' compiler instead  of 'xlc_r' - not sure exactly what is the difference between the two, I guess  it may be different C language level/standard and linking with some other set  of default libraries. And everything works great! I've just checked couple of  PHP scripts with MySQL - works perfectly fine. It can't be really called  a 'bug' in Apache software, rather some weirdness of IBM C compiler, but I felt  like reporting it to save some time to thers trying to compile it, as I've  spent 3 days myself, must admit - I am no computer programmer. By the way, perl  5.8.5 compiles, builds and tests with both flavors - either with 'cc_r'  or 'xlc_r'.   Regards  Alexei	As far as we can tell, this problem is due to a bug in the native AIX compiler when building Apache at -O2.  A special patch will resolve this; go to http://www.apache.org/~trawick/aixstatus.html and search for 'optimization problem'.  Please re-open if this patch does not resolve the problem. Well, I've been reading about this as well (perl, for example, does not even  compile with '-O2', while it does with '-O2 -qstrict'). I have tried 'xlc_r -O'  with Apache as well to no avail, while 'cc_r' compiles equally well with '-O'  and '-O2' and I could not see any difference in Apache behavior so far (at  least with PHP5/MySQL CGI scripts). To me looks more like a difference in set  of default libraries to link with.  Maybe this deserves to be put in some sort of README for Apache, since both AIX  5.1 and C for AIX 6.0 are fairly recent products. An excerpt from 'man xlc': [quote] -O        Optimize generated code. -O2       Same as -O. [unquote]  Actual 'httpd' binaries do not compare, when compiled with '-O' and '-O2'. Maybe IBM does not tell all the truth...  regards  Alexey Yes, putting it in README.platforms is a good idea; I'll do that. Yes, I have applied the 'optimize bug' patch, but I forgot to mention it in my  initial report, thanks for pointing it out. "Apache AIX status' document  mentions 'xlc' as working (with '-O') when called as 'xlc_r' or 'xlC_r'. Seems  that in C for AIX V6.0 this behavior had changed and it is better to resort  to 'cc_r'. I guess the case could be closed :-)  Alexei okay, I can verify that with xlc 5.0.2.5 I don't need the patch if I use CC=cc_r CFLAGS=-O2 but I do need the patch if I use CC=xlc_r CFLAGS=-O2  the difference in xlc_r and cc_r behavior can be seen in /etc/vac.cfg, which specifies what libraries and other options are used based on the wrapper (CC)  the difference is in the default options   cc_r has -qlanglvl=extended,-qnoro,-qnoroconst  xlc_r has -qansialias  all other options, libraries, stubs, and library paths are the same  I've updated README.platforms to point out   stable location of the server/core.c patch   xlc_r -O2 needs the patch   cc_r  -O2 doesn't need the patch  Thanks for your research on this topic!

If an administrator installs a malicious CRL file, this bug can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  The function ssl_callback_SSLVerify_CRL() in modules/ssl/ssl_engine_kernel.c calls ap_log_error() with data from the CRL as the format string instead of using the data as parameters, leading to a security breach.

30592	null	RESOLVED		Eberhard Ruff	1092230520000	1106348876000		failover for authentication with AuthLDAPURL is not possible Using a .htaccess to authenticate against an LDAP server:  AuthType Basic AuthLDAPURL 'ldap://localhost ldap.host.com:10389/ou=myorg?uid?sub' Require valid-user  Failover is only working if all LDAP servers using the same port. The port number can only be specified after the last server.  It should be possible to specify port numbers for all ldap servers.	The URL handling follows the RFC for LDAP URL handling, and is controlled by the LDAP library being used - which may or may not allow what you describe.  In v2.1 of httpd, which now uses apr v1.0, the URL handling is no longer done by the LDAP library, but by custom code in apr-util instead, making this possible.  Will have to check RFC implications first though.  I have already been looking into this one.  The issue is that the URL_parse  function assigns the port value to the first :port that it find in the URL.   It uses that port in the ldap_init() call which becomes the default port for  any host that does not also specify a port.  The solution is to always pass  the default ports (ie. 389 or 636) in the ldap_init() calls in apr_ldap_init ().  This will cause the default ports to be used if the host does not specify  a port.  LDAP will do the right thing for any other host:port in the URL. There are 2 patches for this bug, one in apr_ldap_url.c and the other in  util_ldap.c.  The parsing function in apr_ldap_url.c was assuming that the  host string would only contain a single host.  Therefore it truncated the host  portion of the URL after the first :port that it found.  If the last host in  the URL also specified a :port, then it assumed that all hosts could be  reachable on the same port.  Once this was fixed then util_ldap.c needed to call apr_ldap_init() always  specifying the default ports for LDAP and LDAPS.  If the host string also  includes ports, they will override any port specified in the port parameter.   Both of these fixes have been committed to HEAD and need to be backported.   As Graham mentioned above, the ldap url parsing in 2.0 is handled by the LDAP  libraries.  ldap_parse_url() truncates the host list after the first host:port  is found.  There appears to be some inconsistencies between the different  SDK's with regards to this function.  To fix this issue in 2.0, at least the  recent patches to apr_ldap_url.c would have to be backported and all of the  platforms would have to use the apr version of ldap_parse_url() rather than  the LDAP library version. I am assuming that the patches have been applied. If not, please reopen this bug. 			Brad Nicholes	Graham Leggett

I just checked a default Not Found (404) page.  It is valid HTML 2.0 (though only by accident).  Either it's a content negotiation issue (what language are you seeing pages in?) or you have misunderstood valid HTML. I don't think it was by accident ;) It is by accident.  It contains XHTML syntax <hr />.  That is an SGML abbreviated form that is valid only due to a defect in the HTML specs (see for example http://valet.webthing.com/page/parsemode.html for explanation).  Any truly compliant browser will display the closing '>' as text after the horizontal rule.  Since that is clearly not the intention, it is relying on tag-soup parsing.  Replace that with HTML <hr> and it becomes valid without relying on SHORTTAGS. Oh, this was modified by someone who didn't know better. *That* is the accident ;-) (and a bug). A <hr /> tag is only valid in an XHTML document.  If the document is XHTML it should also technical be served with the correct MIME type 'text/application-xml' not 'text/html'. This however is the subject of much debate and it is generaly safer to leave it as 'text/html' untill browsers reliably know what to do with it. As Nick already said, <hr /> *is* valid HTML (because of shorttags). But it's a bug though, since not intended to be there. Fixed in 2.1 and proposed for backport. Backported to v2.0. 			Andr??

I added a log message to the ap_auth_nonce() function in the standard version of http_core.c from  Apache 1.3.31. (This function was added in 1.3.31). It's short so here's the whole function with the log  message:  API_EXPORT(const char *) ap_auth_nonce(request_rec *r) {     core_dir_config *conf;     conf = (core_dir_config *)ap_get_module_config(r->per_dir_config,                                                    &core_module);     if (conf->ap_auth_nonce)        return conf->ap_auth_nonce;      /* Ideally we'd want to mix in some per-directory style      * information; as we are likely to want to detect replay      * across those boundaries and some randomness. But that      * is harder due to the adhoc nature of .htaccess memory      * structures, restarts and forks.      *      * But then again - you should use AuthDigestRealmSeed in your config      * file if you care. So the adhoc value should do.      */ \tchar* nonce = ap_psprintf(r->pool,'%pp%pp%pp%pp%pp',            (void *)&((r->connection->local_addr).sin_addr ),            (void *)ap_user_name,            (void *)ap_listeners,            (void *)ap_server_argv0,            (void *)ap_pid_fname); \tap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_NOERRNO|APLOG_INFO, r->server,              'nonce = '%s'', nonce);  \treturn nonce; }  The log message shows that this function returns one value when called to provide the nonce to pass to  the client, and a different value when called later to verify that the nonce received from the client was  the one sent (check_nonce()). So the check fails, and the client cannot access the realm. The change is  in the first of the 5 concatenated addresses (the one based on the request record address):  [Sat Aug 28 16:40:53 2004] [info] nonce = '82b834813e608261c0bffffd52803b98'  (User enters name and password at a WebDAV client...)  [Sat Aug 28 16:40:58 2004] [info] nonce = '82e834813e608261c0bffffd52803b98' [Sat Aug 28 16:40:58 2004] [error] [client 17.221.41.169] Client is using a nonce which was not issued  by this server for this context: / [Sat Aug 28 16:40:58 2004] [info] nonce = '82e834813e608261c0bffffd52803b98'  (User gets the name and password dialog again...)  The problem can be worked around by specifying the AuthDigestRealmSeed directive, or by switching  to mod_auth_digest, but existing configurations are broken by this.	Thanks for the report.

31036	null	CLOSED		Swedish IT Incident Centre	1094210820000	1097691984000		Apache mod_rewrite DBM file zero byte overflow (Initially reported as SITIC Vulnerability Advisory SA04-003, redefined as bug  after discussion with ASF security team)  Apache's mod_rewrite module can be made to write one zero byte in an arbitrary memory position outside of a char array, causing DoS or possibly buffer overflows.  The function lookup_map_dbmfile() in modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c copies data from a DBM file to the char array buf in a _secure_ manner, but it zero-terminates the array afterwards in an _insecure_ manner. If the key that is looked up has an n bytes long value, a zero byte will be written in the memory position n bytes from the start of the char array buf, causing a crash.  HTTP requests that exploit this problem are not shown in the access log. The error log will show Segmentation faults, though.  Mitigating factors:  Exploitation requires someone manually configuring the system to use a DBM file and then someone (else) storing malicious data in that DBM file.  This bug was discovered by Ulf Harnhammar for SITIC, Swedish IT  Incident Centre.

But I don't know how much validation the particular apr_dbm implementations will give you on .dsize. Hmm, I don't understand ... why? See how the pstrmemdup implementation behaves if passed in n=ULONG_MAX.  But regardless.  only if apr_size_t == ulong. Good question... I think, much of our code relies on apr_size_t being big enough. The fix at http://www.apache.org/~nd/dbmmap_2.0.patch got 4 votes for backport to v2.0.53, and the backport has been committed.  Has this fix been applied to v2.1?  It's *taken* from 2.1 ;-) Cool :) Didn't see a link in STATUS to the commit though, only an external link to the patch - just making sure :)  Patch already applied to v1.3.

Bug found in 2.0.51-rc2, present in 2.0-HEAD, not present in 2.0.50. Found on Solaris 8/SPARC/gcc, verified on Fedora Core 2/Athlon/gcc.  Steps to reproduce: - Use 2.0.51-rc2, including mod_cache, all modules built static, no third party modules, built from pristine sources from httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/ - Use configuration directives: CacheEnable disk / CacheRoot /cache - Content will be cached normally - Clean out cache and add directive: CacheDisable /foo/ - No content at all is cached anymore, including content not under /foo  Some debugging shows that the urllen field of struct cache_disable is always 0, causing the CacheDisable test to always succeed, causing mod_cache to always decline to cache (this all in cache_util.c). Strangely enough, the urllen does appear to be set correctly when the config file is parsed (mod_cache.c).  Removing the urllen field from structs cache_enable and cache_disable, and replacing references to the field with strlen() calls fixes the problem.	Yup I am encoutering this bug too in 2.0.52..  The issue is in ap_cache_providers_list when it iterates through the 'disabled' urls, all the urllen's are 0 in line 86 of cache_control.c.  They are set correclt when tehy are assigned in the the command handler.. Created an attachment (id=13129) Patch to fix the issue  Patch applied to CVS Head.

31226	null	RESOLVED		frederic bregier	1095188160000	1129909939000		AddOutputFilterByType deflate not active with mod_proxy I use Apache 2.0 to have a reverse proxy web server that compress with mod_deflate the web pages in direction of the users. Applications behind (on application 'proxified' server) generate : - text/html document - application/pdf or others like jpg document  both using an url such as http://myreverseproxy/application/application.exe or application.php whatever like this.  The url is always the same for one application, only the context (session) implies the answear (html or pdf document). We want to compress document with type mime = text, but not those with jpg or pdf type mime.  But here is the problem, with proxypass and proxypassreverse :  1) using SetOutputFilter DEFLATE implies that everything is compressed even if the mime type is a pdf or jpg since the exclusion can be based  only on url, which is not possible here. We can exclude files like http://myreverseproxy/application/image.jpg but not the same jpg create dynamically by  http://myreverseproxy/application/application.exe  2) using AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain compressed nothing at all, neither html neither pdf or jpg. And accordingly to the documentation and sources on the web, this second solution should be the correct one. Every mime types are defined and ok, the returned documents are using the correct mime type (text/html, application/pdf, ...).  I found not much information on the web on a reverse proxy with compression at the same time. It is quite a big problem for us since we cannot use the web compression in this conditions. Has someone have this problem too ? What can I do to correct this ?  thank you for your help	AddOutputFilterbyType is known to be broken.  Use mod_filter instead: http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/mod/mod_filter.html  Thank you for your note on the broken AddOutputFilterByType. I read the manual page of mod_filter. First, it is only valid with Apache 2.1.  Is it enough stable for this use (reverse proxy and deflate) for production ?  Second, I try to think what could be the syntax of the filter.  FilterDeclare compressed Content-Type FilterProvider compressed deflate $text/html # is it deflate or mod_deflate ? FilterProvider compressed deflate $text/plain FilterProtocol compressed 'change=yes' <Location /application> FilterChain compressed </Location>   But I miss a point. What about the proxy definition ? Is the proxy (proxypass and reverse) applied before this filter, or should I make another Filter with the final filterchain as FilterChain proxyfied compressed ? Therefore, how can I specify the directives for this filter  (proxypass and reverse) ? What about special mod_deflate directives (deflatecompressionlevel for  instance) ?  Also there is the registering of the modules with ap_register_output_filter. Is is done with all standard modules and with what names ? (for mod_proxy, mod_deflate ?)  I know now this module is new, so I can understand that the manual is not  completed. Thank you again This is not really a support forum.  Please direct support questions somewhere more appropriate, such as the apache-users mailinglist or a suitable webservers newsgroup.  But in brief,  (1) it works fine with 2.0  (2) your filter syntax looks fine to me  (3) It doesn't affect your proxy setup or your mod_deflate directives.  Stop looking for complexity where there is none! Thank you for this help. For everyone having the same problem and looking in this bug, I place the solution that works for me. With standard proxy and deflate directives, I placed the following  FilterDeclare compressed Content-Type FilterProvider compressed deflate $text/html FilterProvider compressed deflate $text/plain FilterProvider compressed deflate $text/css #FilterProtocol compressed deflate 'change=yes' FilterChain compressed  I had to download spcifically the mod_filter.c through your web page, Nick (http://www.apache.org/~niq/) since it is not in Apache sources (neither 2.0 or 2.1). I understand since the first release is of august 2004.  I comment FilterProtocol since it produces an error in apache ('FilterProtocol: No such filter'). I try with and without 'deflate'.  Well, at this time, it seems to work as intended. Since it is a quite new module, I have to test it intensively since it is for production later on.  Thank you ! Bug closed !   *** Bug 14335 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** (In reply to comment #1) > AddOutputFilterbyType is known to be broken.  Use mod_filter instead:  The question to me is: Why is it broken? While having a look a PR14335 I found out that the reason for this 'brokenness' seems to be the following lines from ap_add_output_filters_by_type in core.c:      /* We can't do anything with proxy requests, no content-types or if      * we don't have a filter configured.      */     if (r->proxyreq != PROXYREQ_NONE || !r->content_type ||         !conf->ct_output_filters) {         return;     }  Does anybody remember the reason why we cannot do anything on proxied resources?

It is part of httpd 2.1 and was protmoted from its experimental state to be a regular module a while ago. The configure switch for mod_filter is --enable-filter.  [..cut..] I looked at that a while back and nobody could work out why the check is there either.

I'm also having a possibly related problem with explosive growth in memory usage by Apache.  It's also intermittent, sometimes showing up minutes after Apache is restarted, sometimes showing up hours later.  Over the course of a few seconds an apache process will grow from it's normal size of approximately 50 megs to 500 megs.	Do you have CGI script which output a lot of data? The byterange filter will consume memory proportional to output for such scripts, bug 29962.  From gdb can you:  print *b print *(struct cgi_bucket_data *)b->data  if you do:  up up print *f->r  you should be able to see which particular CGI script has triggered the segfault. Output from print *b:  $1 = {link = {next = 0x8311a10, prev = 0x8311d80}, type = 0x40855520,   length = 4294967295, start = -1, data = 0x8327440,   free = 0x805ea74 <apr_bucket_free>, list = 0x8311720}  Output from print *(struct cgi_bucket_data *)b->data:  $2 = {pollset = 0x8327448, r = 0x8321968}  Thanks for the tip on identifying which script was being run, it turns out it died in an index.html file that uses SSI to include output from two different CGI scripts.

Just to confirm, you are using an unpatched 2.0.50 built directly from source?  The backtrace is actually quite confusing.  It references functions from the new CGI bucket type, but these are only actually used by the CGI handler, not when an SSI page invokes CGI scripts directly, so they shouldn't be in the picture at all.   Some updates/corrections:  1) Yes, it's been compiled from source, without any patches.  2) There are two separate cgi scripts on our index page, one does banner rotation for a banner, it is included four times (once each for 4 banners), the other creates a list of links based on the amount bid for placement, it's included twice.  The first script uses a text file db, while the second script uses MySQL.  Both are included with virtual includes.  Here's a sample of one of the sections with the includes (I can't give you the scripts themselves, they were purchased from someone else).  <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/ads/run.cgi?id=homeworkersa2'--> <!-- homeworkersa2 --> </CENTER> <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/search/include.cgi?keywords=main&desc=1&url=1&cost=1&show=1&include=1' --> <CENTER> <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/ads/run.cgi?id=homeworkersa3'--> <IMG SRC='/images/spacer.gif' WIDTH='160' HEIGHT='5'> <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/ads/run.cgi?id=homeworkersa4'--> <!-- homeworkersa4 --> </CENTER>  <hr class='green'>  <!--#include virtual='/cgi-bin/search/include.cgi?keywords=main&start=1&bt=10&desc=1&url=1&cost=1&show=9&include=1' -->  3) I tried the advice in bug 29962, it didn't help at all.  I'm still getting processes that bloat up to a huge size and I don't think it's related to sending large files through the server.  We only have a two scripts that I know of that send out large files and neither one appears to be accessed as often as these processes appear (I often have to restart apache multiple times during the day, it take as little as 5 minutes or as long as several hours to nearly exhaust all available memory).  4) We've upgraded to 2.0.51 as of this morning, I'm still seeing the memory problem and the segmentation faults.  I'm going to attempt to create another core dump with the new httpd. Created an attachment (id=12835) possible fix  OK, I think I see what's happening, but I haven't got a reproduction case, so testing with the above patch would be good. I've applied the patch but I'm still getting Segmentation Faults and the memory growth, and I haven't been able to produce a core dump to examine yet. The patch committed which fixes the issue triggered in the given segfault was:  http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd-2.0/server/util_filter.c?r1=1.100&r2=1.101  so if you could try that and still get more segfaults, please try and get new core dumps.  (Please open a new bug for any new issues)  Thanks for the report and debugging help. It looks like the fix has worked, I don't seem to be able to generate any more core files, and the number of segmentation faults has dropped significantly.  Instead of 6-10 per day, we seem to now be averaging 1 a day (probably on an unrelated issue). Thanks Tyler. Actually, I think I should be thanking you for the quick fix.  :)			Joe Orton	Tyler
31268	null	RESOLVED		Daniel Rench	1095363720000	1176119540000		ab: add an option to override the target host When testing a server, the 'Host:' header can matter. I needed a way to disconnect the target host as derived from the URL on the command line and the 'Host:' header that ab sends.  I wrote a patch against ab from 2.0.50 that adds a '-F hostname' option (which I will attach once this ticket exists).  Say I have a new server and want to see how it compares with an existing one with a vhost named www.example.com. Rather than play with hosts files or DNS, this patch allows you to test 'newbox' by running:  ab -F newbox http://www.example.com/	Created an attachment (id=12753) patch to add hostname override option to ab  This seems invalid to me.  We can send the Host: Header as part of the address... but specifying it again with a special flag just seems wrong. I've had to add same feature (host to connect to != host in Host request header field) to specialized testing clients so that I could do some automated vhost testing without hacking the system.  Any other opinions from the crowd? I also considered doing something along the lines of the enhancement request #26554 method for overriding the 'User-Agent:' header. Maybe a better way? hmm. Yes, I would condier a generic method to set any Header in a Key = Value Format to be better than specific methods for each header. Created an attachment (id=19526) Patch to override headers using the existing -H option  Have attached a patch using which one can override the value of the Host, User-Agent and/or Accept header that ab tacks onto requests, by specifying an alternate value for the header using the existing -H option. -1 on implementation, but +1 on concept. Arvind, I think your solution is pretty elegant, and am in  favor of using the existing -H option to override the headers in question. However, you are no longer  sending the Accept: and User-Agent headers to POST Requests when they are not overridden.   Also, the logic regarding the overridable headers in the if (posting <= 0) block is hard to read because  of the inversion (only print the headers when their opt_foo is NOT set). Perhaps you can pull the part  where you construct these headers outside the if (posting <= 0) block (bonus: you avoid duplicating  the logic), use proper if () statements instead of the ? operator and put a comment on both branches of  the if() to tell the reader what is going on like /* Header not overridden, print default */ and /* Header  overridden, no need to send because it is already in the hdrs string */.   Would you like to fix the above and resubmit?  Thanks for your feedback. I'll address the issues you've pointed out and resubmit. Created an attachment (id=19535) Revised patch to override headers using the existing -H option  The attached patch address the following issues that were identified with the previous revision of this patch: * POST requests send an Accept: and User-Agent: header when they are not overridden * Logic regarding the overrideable headers has been pulled outside the if (posting <= 0) block * Uses if () statements (with appropriate comments) instead of the ? operator +1 to Arvind's revised patch.  Thanks for reviewing the patch Sander.  The patch also fixes http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26554 Committed in r526872. Thanks Arvind for your patch.

31440	null	RESOLVED		Andreas Krennmair	1096310760000	1203412158000		htpasswd salt generation weakness I noticed a salt generation weakness when using htpasswd in MD5 mode on platforms where rand()  returns only a 32 bit value: since the MD5 salt is 48 bits wide, the last 2 or 3 characters are always filled  with '.'.  $ htpasswd -m -c /tmp/htpasswdtest a New password:  Re-type new password:  Adding password for user a $ cat /tmp/htpasswdtest a:$apr1$sTQf/...$v6RZCfMprmLq5vMTzpwH2/ $	Created an attachment (id=12871) fix to the htpasswd salt generation weakness  This attached patch would lead to a more random MD5 salt:  $ ./htpasswd -m -c /tmp/htpasswdtest2 b New password:  Re-type new password:  Adding password for user b $ cat /tmp/htpasswdtest2 b:$apr1$iOJN8Jax$rQLDvG0ALByOBtHgN2wk7/ $ Created an attachment (id=21429) patch against httpd-2.2.8 to resolve weak PRNG seeding  Andreas, I think you're on the right track, but your patch only adds the appearance of greater randomness. The core problem here is poor seeding of the PRNG. Every salted output from htpasswd starts with using time() to feed srand(). Even with your patch, htpasswd will always use the same seed at the any given time.  The most important thing that needs to change is the calls to srand(). Here's a patch that keeps your nice 48-bit padding and adds better seeding. If the user sets a RANDOM_SEED environment variable, htpasswd will use that file/device. If not, it will try to use /dev/urandom. If it cannot use /dev/urandom or the user provides an unusable file/device name, it will fall back to using time() but will print a warning to STDERR. Also (untested!) if the user is on a platform with 32-bit integers, htpasswd will re-seed the PRNG as needed, to improve the chances of a true 48-bit salt.  -Peter  Created an attachment (id=21433) patch for httpd 1.3.39  same idea, but for the 1.3.x codebase > Andreas, I think you're on the right track, but your patch only adds the > appearance of greater randomness.

Even with your patch, htpasswd will always use the same seed at the > any given time.  This is not a matter of randomness (or at least that was not my point), it's a matter of how the salt of the hash looks like. With the old method (which I fixed with my patch from 2004), an attacker could base a precomputation attack on the assumption that the salt only has 32 bits, even though the format would allow up to 48 bits of salt.   Of course, even with 32 bits of salt, a precomputation still seems quite infeasible, but it still doesn't exhaust the possible maximum of 48 bits of salt (which obviously must have been in the mind of the original authors, otherwise they would have spread the 32 bits of rand() to 6 bytes instead of 8 bytes). And that was the original point of my patch. Any attacker who has the same PRNG as the system where htpasswd runs would be foolish to blindly precompute even a 32 bit apr1 dictionary. 32 bits of time() represents 136 years worth of htpasswd execution with the current srand() code. In a given month, there are less than 22 bits worth of salt when using srand(time(NULL)), 17 bits in a day, 12 bits in an hour, 6 bits in a minute, 0 in a second. 29 bits is all it takes to stretch back to the beginning of Apache, before the apr1 MD5 algorithm appeared in 1.3.6 -- even with your improvement.   To 'fix' htpasswd so it takes full advantage of the apr1 spec's 48 bits of salt, it is necessary to fix the srand() problem, too. With your generate_salt() and my seed_prng(), htpasswd finally produces nicely random 48-bit salts for apr1.   You are right, I stand corrected. Now if only somebody could apply the patches to SVN trunk... Using generate_salt instead of to64 makes sense.....  The second patch to use better PRNG seeding, we should just use the APR APIs for randomness, apr_generate_random_bytes: http://apr.apache.org/docs/apr/1.2/group__apr__random.html Committed improved salt string generation in r629159: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=629159  Committed improved rand seed generation in r629164: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=629164  			Andreas Krennmair	Paul Querna	Peter Watkins

If you must pass an '-o' option to apxs, it must be like '-o mod_foo.la' otherwise you'll confuse libtool.  Can you try that?

Also... why do I need to say '-o mod_so.la'?  What I really want is 'mod_so.so'.  This won't work for me.  Basically:  I have: tourserve/itour - sources + Apache13 makefile tourserve/itour2 - Apache2 makefile  The apache2 makefile just overrides a couple of knobs and includes the apache13 makefile.  But for some reason apxs decides to dump files into my source directories instead of my current directory.  Here's a fix that prevents it, but only if you give a -o option to apxs, I haven't figured out how to fix it without -o.

31472	null	CLOSED		Jack Repenning	1096487280000	1099438627000		' The magic file provided with mod_mime_magic contains a typo in the line for QuickTime videos of type  'moov'.    Discovered in 2.0.50; confirmed by inspection in 2.0.52.  The result is a parse error:  [Wed Sep 29 10:03:57 2004] [error] [client 10.1.6.217] mod_mime_magic: unexpected state 3; could be  caused by bad data in magic file  ... and an Internal Server Error  Of course, this only arises if the file has not already been recognized based on file name, which I  believe is done by mod_mime.  The typo is a trailing space at the end of the line.   To reproduce: - get yourself an Apple Quicktime movie of type 'moov' (you can grab    http://u2.netgate.net/~jack/file_14.mov or .../file_14.dat - rename it, if necessary, to some unobvious name, if necessary ('file_14.dat' is unobvious enough) - drop it into your htdocs directrory - add a link to it in some page  - make sure mod_mime and mod_mime_magic are enabled     (http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_mime_magic.html)   - hit the link  Expected: it should show the movie Actual result: it chokes  Fix: remove the trailing space on the line (patch attached momentarily, as if you really needed that);  restart server  Hit the link again: Result: see the movie	Created an attachment (id=12897) patch for magic file docs/conf/magic  Oops, sorry wrong URL.  The sample 'moov' file is http://www.repenning.homeip.net/file_14.mov  There's nothing special about it, though: any QTime movie file will do.   Note that there's also some evidence that this typo affects other file types.    That is: there's only one typo, the one for files of type 'moov'.  But it affects parsing of the magic  file: mod_mime_magic croaks--really, before it's read the entry, and hence it's not reacting  specifically to the fact that the file being touched is 'moov', but rather to the fact that it's not any  of the *other* types named earlier in the file.  So something amounting to the same problem arises  for any file of any type that's completely unknown to the magic file (the reported case is Stuffit!  archives, which are not described anywhere in the magic file).    Reproducing the false behavior in these cases is harder, I can't provide you a complete recipe:  these cases produce the same error_log output as the 'moov', but since they're not described at all,  the resulting behavior is not so far from correct.  In our case, we're also providing a .htaccess file  for these, which includes MIME info, and the croak in mod_mime_magic seems to mean that  .htaccess is never consulted, and hence we're not getting the right behavior from these other file  types, either.  I'm not sure of all the steps necessary to set up such a .htaccess file, but I have  experimentally confirmed that, if I fix the typo on the 'moov' line, the .htaccess files for StuffIt! files  comes back into play, and everything's peachy again. Thanks Jack, committed for 2.0.53.			Jack Repenning	Joe Orton
31483	null	RESOLVED		Popolon	1096542120000	1188213405000		add svgz in mime.types file There is no description of standard svgz file (gziped SVG) in mime.type definition file, this is in w3 SVG draft, and most SVG viewer can ungzip them.  image/svg+xml                   svg  could be replaced by:  image/svg+xml                   svg svgz  to resolve the issue.   As showed in the following SVG draft appendice, it can save 80% bandwidth and disk space, and for example   http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-SVG11-20020430/minimize.html	It seems quite ambiguous to me if this is really the right thing to do.  Is a gzipped svg file still a plain image/xvg+xml or is it an image/xvg+xml with a content-encoding implied?  I'd tend to believe the latter, in which case it does not make sense to change the mime.types file unless there is also a corresponding AddEncoding directive.  The svg spec does not seem perfectly clear on this topic.  But I don't see anywhere where it says that applications conforming to the spec must understand gzipped documents.  So that implies that the gzip is not part of the content type, and we shouldn't change mime.types.  Feel free to provide evidence to the contrary (and reopen the bug if you do so). Hi,  The SVG 1.1 Errata should clarify this issue, svg viewers should be able to  load gzipped svgz content no matter how it's loaded, svgz does not require a  content-encoding header to be loaded.  Unfortunately we're still waiting for  that errata to be published, but you can see details at:  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.xml.svg.devel/25178/  or on the www-svg mailing list archives.  I think it would be nice to also have AddEncoding for svgz for the non svg user  agents, but it's not essential Added to trunk in rev 570206.			Jim Ley	Joshua Slive	Roy T. Fielding

I have log entries with http error code 70007, too, but I don't have any entries in the error_log. mod_ssl isn't used. here the errors come from POST requests  apache 2.0.54 / php 4.4.0 LogLevel warn This is a bug in the default_handler, not in mod_ssl.  The default_handler itself returns the ap_pass_brigade return value; the handler hook is supposed to return an OK/DECLINED/HTTP_* error code, so this is broken. *** Bug 36828 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Since Joe claims that this is where the logging bug should be followed up, I'm continuing conversation here.  If this is the same problem as reported, this problem affects EVERY request, not just reverse proxy.  (if not, then Joe referred me incorrectly)  This is currently affecting roughly 2k log entries per night on my personal colo machine.  It's tens of thousands more on real production websites.  It's a fatal flaw in one of Apache's most basic operations -- log the request.  What do we need to do to get developers to stop playing with grand new features that aren't crucial to basic operation, and fix the core?

I couldn't really convince myself what the correct behaviour was when I looked at this before.  If there is a 404 response which suffers from an SSL-layer error, why is it better to log a 500 than a 404; i.e. is it better to just log r->status in the non-success case?  The real response code might be a useful diagnostic. Also thanks from me Jeff. I guess it is a good idea to log the original return code in the error log in the INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR case. I think it should be sufficient to log this for DEBUG loglevel only. Thoughts? (based on Joe's comments) >If there is a 404 response which suffers from an SSL-layer >error, why is it better to log a 500 than a 404  It isn't, but that doesn't go through this path.  (default handler will return HTTP_NOT_FOUND instead of calling ap_pass_brigade() with a file bucket)  but a filter could have modified r->status to indicate an error (e.g., invalid range)  >i.e. is it better to just log r->status in the non-success case?  Agreed in general.  I'm still nervous about r->status still OK when we get here.

It would be better to avoid having such errors logged N times by all N filters in the output chain, that kind of thing creates confusion.  moving discussion to dev@httpd for the time being...

It's the apache or third-party handler it's running under that wants fixing.  If it's apache's mod_cgi or mod_cgid, it's an apache bug.  Otherwise you need to look elsewhere. I'm sorry, but I'm confused.  You are saying this isn't an Apache bug... but it might be an Apache bug, report it to them?  Huh?  (yes I'm being a little dense on purpose, but it is honestly confusing)  This is a bone stock apache configuration.  No external modules.  This is an Apache bug one way or the other, and reported in the apache bugzilla... how is it that you are claiming 'not your bug?' (In reply to comment #37) > I'm sorry, but I'm confused.  You are saying this isn't an Apache bug... but it > might be an Apache bug, report it to them?  Huh?  The default handler (which *this* bug report references) doesn't handle PUT.  So what you're describing is  either a different bug or a notabug.  It absolutely cannot be *this* bug, though it could be the same thing  in another handler.  > This is a bone stock apache configuration.  No external modules.  You need to tell us what your script is running under.  Is it mod_cgi or mod_cgid? Not cgid.  I assume it's part of mod_cgi.  It's really just  Script  PUT   /path/to/put-handler.pl  To what extent is this changed if *.pl is handled by   AddHandler cgiwrapper *.cgi *.pl Action cgiwrapper /path/to/wrapper  And again, it still seems like the it's using the return code (which is very OS-dependent) instead of a result code returned by the application. (In reply to comment #32) > This has been backported. It is part of 2.0.56 and later.  Thanks for the reply.  The reason I asked is that I am seeing the following with 2.0.59:  68.174.9.93 - - [13/Sep/2006:16:57:24 +0100] 'POST /articles/comment/66 HTTP/1.1' 70007 607 'http://typo.submonkey.net/articles/2006/03/09/setting-interface-link-settings-in-suns-openboot' 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; MRA 4.3 (build 01218))'  The target URL of the post is proxied by mod_proxy to a lighttpd backend (which is probably not working properly). This bug has been fixed.  But after yesterday's exchange with Jo Rhett, I looked at mod_cgi and  mod_cgid, and found what appears to be a similar problem in both of them, when  they return an error status from the *input* filters if they fail to read a  request body (as in a POST/PUT request).  I've fixed that similar bug - which I think you're both describing - in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=442758 You jumped right to the chase -- I was busy building a test case to prove that effect to you.

But looking  up at comment #40, it was the proxy, so patching mod_cgi has no effect on you.  I've just looked at mod_proxy in 2.0, and there is indeed the same bug there  yet again (though it's deeper - in the mod_proxy_http provider).  It's also  rather more complex, but always (AFAICT) comes from ap_proxy_http_request,  which in fact returns apr_status_t values.  So you can fix it by applying the  same fix at line 1899 of proxy_http.c.

FWIW, I've implemented a higher-level fix, so that if this bug turns up in yet  more handlers, apache will handle it internally rather than send a bogus  response to the client.  See http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=448711 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=450808 Thanks Nick, that looks like the most sensible fix.

31782	null	RESOLVED		Ray Ferguson	1098206760000	1115157337000		AllowOverride limitations can be overcome w/ Location directive, a note to that effect in the docs would be nice. The allowoverride categories are sometimes too general.  For instance, you may want to let webmasters override some of the Options category, but not all of it.  Most often, you might want to restrict ExecCGI or Includes, but otherwise, give controll to the webmaster.  This can be done with the following:  <Directory /> AllowOverride All </Directory>  <Location /> Options +IncludesNoEXEC -ExecCGI </Location>  Since Location supercedes Directory and htaccess settings, this effectively gives control of a subset of the Options category to htaccess users.  I think this is a fairly common thing to want to do, so making a note of it somewhere in the documentation would be a nice addition.	Thanks for the interesting example.  I've added it along with some other comments to the htaccess tutorial.			Joshua Slive

32529	null	RESOLVED		Mitch Frazier	1102138260000	1102502700000		ProxyPass segmentation fault on SMP x86_64 The included patch is for openssl but its not 100% clear to me if the real bug is in apache or in openssl, fixing it in openssl was easiest.  I emailed the bug to the openssl folks also.  apache version:  2.0.48-146 openssl version: 0.9.7b-125 OS:              SuSE 9.0 SMP/x86_64 Kernel:          2.4.21-260-smp  The problem I'm seeing is that apache will not perform a 'ProxyPass' to another SSL host.  The openssl function ssl_verify_cert_chain() [ssl/ssl_cert.c] stores the SSL* pointer in the X509_STORE_CTX context with the following code:    X509_STORE_CTX_set_ex_data(&ctx,SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx(),s);  the apache callback function ssl_callback_SSLVerify() [modules/ssl/ssl_kernel_engine.c] then retrieves this value with the following code:    SSL *ssl = (SSL *)X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data(ctx);  which is just a macro to retrieve index 0 of the ex_data.  This fails on the above system.  I don't have an exact match single processor 32-bit machine for comparison testing but I tested on a close match and it works fine.  The following patch fixes the problem on the above system:  ----------------------- diff -Naur openssl-0.9.7b-orig/ssl/ssl_cert.c openssl-0.9.7b/ssl/ssl_cert.c --- openssl-0.9.7b-orig/ssl/ssl_cert.c    2004-12-03 18:35:40.000000000 -0800 +++ openssl-0.9.7b/ssl/ssl_cert.c    2004-12-03 18:36:20.000000000 -0800 @@ -467,6 +467,7 @@      if (SSL_get_verify_depth(s) >= 0)          X509_STORE_CTX_set_depth(&ctx, SSL_get_verify_depth(s));      X509_STORE_CTX_set_ex_data(&ctx,SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx(),s); +    X509_STORE_CTX_set_app_data(&ctx,s);       /* We need to set the verify purpose. The purpose can be determined by       * the context: if its a server it will verify SSL client certificates -----------------------  The bug is that a callback function has no way of retrieving the value returned by SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx(), in apache's case it uses 0 via the X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data() macro.  This may not be the 'correct' ultimate fix as I'm not sure if there's a reason why index 0 might not be available.  The 'ctx' structure above is stack allocated and only used for the duration of the ssl_verify_cert_chain() call.	Could you:  1) describe the failure you see 2) reproduce this with the vanilla 2.0.52 release rather than the SuSE package  The failure is that if I include a ProxyPass statement from one SSL enabled host to another SSL enabled, as soon as I try to access a page that should be proxied from the other host the child process in apache seg faults and I see nothing in my browser.

(In reply to comment #2) This is a duplicate of #3 below. I am unable to reproduce this bug with a stock 2.0.52 apache on the same system with more or less the same configuration (mainly just a change of port numbers).  I also am unable to reproduce it with a stock 2.0.48 apache.  Furthermore, even after applying all of the patches (to 2.0.48) that SuSE uses to build their RPM and using the same compiler options that they use and I still can't reproduce it.  So either the run-time configuration changes somehow affect it or something happens when building the RPM which affects it.  Or maybe I'm just going crazy. To be clear, you were testing the vanilla 2.0.52 and 2.0.48 sources against the *unpatched* version of OpenSSL, not the one you have patched?  Could you try changing the first line of ssl_callback_SSLVerify as follows, instead:  -    SSL *ssl            = (SSL *)X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data(ctx); +    SSL *ssl = X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_data(ctx, +                                         SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx());  I can't really see why that segfault could happen in the first place, though.

The reason that its happening is that in some cases the openssl code is storing the SSL* pointer at an index of 1 rather than 0 (the  X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data() macro always uses 0).  I discovered this by putting a fprintf statement in the function X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index() to see what values are being returned as indexes in the SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx() function.  Again, this only happens on the live apache server not the test one.  By looking at the function  SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx() one would presume that this would be impossible.  For reference here's the function:  int SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx(void) \t{ \tstatic volatile int ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx= -1;  \tif (ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx < 0) \t\t{ \t\t/* any write lock will do; usually this branch \t\t * will only be taken once anyway */ \t\tCRYPTO_w_lock(CRYPTO_LOCK_SSL_CTX);  \t\tif (ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx < 0) \t\t\t{ \t\t\tssl_x509_store_ctx_idx=X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index( \t\t\t\t0,'SSL for verify callback',NULL,NULL,NULL); \t\t\t}  \t\tCRYPTO_w_unlock(CRYPTO_LOCK_SSL_CTX); \t\t} \treturn ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx; \t}   Also for reference, here is a dump of the assembler for this code:  Dump of assembler code for function SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx: 0x0000000000024710 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+0>:      sub    $0x8,%rsp 0x0000000000024714 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+4>:      mov    1094190(%rip),%eax        # 0x12f948 <ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx.0> 0x000000000002471a <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+10>:     test   %eax,%eax 0x000000000002471c <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+12>:     js     0x24730 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+32> 0x000000000002471e <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+14>:     mov    1094180(%rip),%eax        # 0x12f948 <ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx.0> 0x0000000000024724 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+20>:     add    $0x8,%rsp 0x0000000000024728 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+24>:     retq 0x0000000000024729 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+25>:     data16 0x000000000002472a <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+26>:     data16 0x000000000002472b <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+27>:     data16 0x000000000002472c <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+28>:     nop 0x000000000002472d <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+29>:     data16 0x000000000002472e <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+30>:     data16 0x000000000002472f <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+31>:     nop 0x0000000000024730 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+32>:     lea    20449(%rip),%rdx        # 0x29718 <empty.0+908> 0x0000000000024737 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+39>:     mov    $0x8d,%ecx 0x000000000002473c <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+44>:     mov    $0xc,%esi 0x0000000000024741 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+49>:     mov    $0x9,%edi 0x0000000000024746 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+54>:     callq  0xc268 0x000000000002474b <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+59>:     mov    1094135(%rip),%eax        # 0x12f948 <ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx.0> 0x0000000000024751 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+65>:     test   %eax,%eax 0x0000000000024753 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+67>:     jns    0x24770 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+96> 0x0000000000024755 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+69>:     lea    20423(%rip),%rsi        # 0x29723 <empty.0+919> 0x000000000002475c <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+76>:     xor    %r8d,%r8d 0x000000000002475f <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+79>:     xor    %ecx,%ecx 0x0000000000024761 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+81>:     xor    %edx,%edx 0x0000000000024763 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+83>:     xor    %edi,%edi 0x0000000000024765 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+85>:     callq  0xc8a8 0x000000000002476a <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+90>:     mov    %eax,1094104(%rip)        # 0x12f948 <ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx.0> 0x0000000000024770 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+96>:     lea    20385(%rip),%rdx        # 0x29718 <empty.0+908> 0x0000000000024777 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+103>:    mov    $0x95,%ecx 0x000000000002477c <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+108>:    mov    $0xc,%esi 0x0000000000024781 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+113>:    mov    $0xa,%edi 0x0000000000024786 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+118>:    callq  0xc268 0x000000000002478b <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+123>:    mov    1094071(%rip),%eax        # 0x12f948 <ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx.0> 0x0000000000024791 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+129>:    add    $0x8,%rsp 0x0000000000024795 <SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx+133>:    retq  The call to CRYPTO_w_lock() should ensure that ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx can only take on a value of zero.  The assembler looks correct to me.  It looks like a thread synchronization problem, but its hard to believe that thread synchronization is broken.  Remember that this is an SMP box.  I'm thinking that the reason I can't reproduce the problem is because the test server is not as heavily loaded as the live server.  Also note that this is running the prefork mpm module.   (In reply to comment #7) I was just reading how the prefork module works and it doesn't even have threads so now I'm more confused. (In reply to comment #7) Also note that the only call to X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index() in apache and openssl is from the function SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx().  (In reply to comment #6) > Could you try changing the first line of ssl_callback_SSLVerify as follows, instead: >  > -    SSL *ssl            = (SSL *)X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data(ctx); > +    SSL *ssl = X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_data(ctx, > +                                         SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx());  This is what I was thinking should be the fix should be, which is what I was driving at in my first post:  >> The bug is that a callback function has no way of retrieving >> the value returned by SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx(), >> in apache's case it uses 0 via the X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data() macro.  Although I was thinking that SSL_get_ex_data_X509_STORE_CTX_idx() wasn't exported from the library and therefore was not callable so I got started down other paths.  Although I can't see where else X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index() is being called from, but maybe I'm not seeing the big picture.  I'm attempting to rebuild the apache RPM now...  Good analysis, thanks.  This could well be one of the insane cases which occurs where libssl.so gets loaded and unloaded during startup but libcrypto.so always stays mapped.  Global variables in libcrypto.so hence don't get reset to their initialization state, but those in libssl.so do:   note that X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index is probably just incrementing some global variable behind the scenes, no doubt (haven't verified that): so if  ssl_x509_store_ctx_idx gets reset to -1, but that global variable does not, then the _idx variable will quite likely get set to '1' next time round.  That might also explain the crash.  You could try some fprintf debugging in both libcrypto and libssl to try and verify this; or LD_DEBUG stuff to see when each is getting loaded and unloaded.

32699	null	RESOLVED		ducrot	1103049000000	1125587742000		t handle aborted connections With apache 2.0.52 and mod_ssl, when trying to make a cgi which will constantly output something, f.e.  #!/usr/bin/perl  $!=1;  print'HTTPS/1.0 200 OK/n'; print'Content-type: text/plain;/n/n';  my $i = 0; while (1) { print 'something $i/n';         $i++;         sleep(1); }  then the script is still running even though the client is disconnected.  This happens only if SSL is in use.  Also, I checked that the same kind of behaviour happens if a plain file is requested (something like lynx https://sever/a_big_file will result for server to still try to send the file even though lynx is killed).  I think the problem is in httpd-2.0.52/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_io.c::bio_filter_out_write()  220         if (bio_filter_out_flush(bio) < 0) { 221             return -1; 222         }  so that actually httpd will try to flush ad eternam the same buffer.  I guess that in fact bio_filter_out_flush() should verify if the connection to the client have been aborted.	Created an attachment (id=13752) fix ssl flush output  make sure bio_filter_out_flush() return an error if the connection have been aborted. Good work, thanks for the patch.  It's always annoying that core_output_filter hides these EPIPE errors :( I committed a different fix, to set outctx->rc = ECONNRESET rather than just fail here, so that an error is logged properly.  Thanks again for tracking this down.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?view=rev&rev=125166 [viewsvn currently disabled]  Since this specific fix, I occasionally get 104 http error codes in my access log. I have tracked it to aborted SSL connections. The patch for this bug returns an APR_ECONNRESET which resolves to 104 on my linux system (Redhat 9 and Fedora4). It shouldn't be returning invalid http error codes when trying to log aborted http connections. Jason could you please file a new bug for that issue?  I don't think it's mod_ssl specific, mod_ssl appears to be doing the right thing here.			Jason Brady	Joe Orton	ducrot
32842	null	CLOSED		Chris Sorisio	1104079380000	1113583378000		FrontPage 2003 compatibility I experienced problems trying to import sites or open sites via Microsoft FrontPage 2003 from a WebDAV-enabled Apache 2.0.52 server.  I could not import or view subdirectories of any parent directory I attempted to open due to '301' errors, although my httpd.conf had the usual 'redirect-carefully' entries for Microsoft WebDAV clients.  From checking my access logfiles, it appears either:  a.  FrontPage 2003 was announced itself as a Mozilla 4.0 client. b.  Apache 2.0.52 was recognizing FrontPage 2003 as a Mozilla 4.0 client.  By adding 'BrowserMatch '^Mozilla 4.0' redirect-carefully' to my httpd.conf, I was able to correct the behavior.  I don't know if the fault here lies with Microsoft FrontPage 2003 or Apache.  Either FP2003 isn't announcing itself properly or Apache isn't properly identifying it.  Sample acccess_log entry for FrontPage 2003:  192.168.100.200 - - [26/Dec/2004:09:25:51 -0500] 'PROPFIND /webdav/images HTTP/1.1' 301 326 '-' 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MS FrontPage 6.0)'	I've added:  BrowserMatch 'MS FrontPage' redirect-carefully  to the default config which should take care of this.

32848	null	RESOLVED		Tim K. Taylor	1104166620000	1105714959000		No independent control of CertificateRequest handshake message SSLv3 draft (5.6.4) and RFC2246 (7.4.4) describe the capability to provide a list a CA distinguished names for defining a desired authorization space. This is currently not possible with mod_ssl.  Even though OpenSSL SSL contexts have both a certificate store for client authentication and a stack of CA names for the CertificateRequest handshake message, they are both created from the same set of certificates. This is ok when the list of trusted roots is also the issuer of the client certificates.  PROBLEM ======= When the trusted roots issue subordinate (intermediate) CA certificates which in turn issue end entity certificates, there is the possibility that some and not all of the intermediate CA certificates are acceptable for the trusted root. However, if the trusted root is used for the CertificateRequest handshake message, all of its intermediate CA's are acceptable. Of course, if the trusted root is left out, the certificate chain cannot be verified.  FIX === Separate and independent control of the CertificateRequest handshake message. Currently, the SSLCACertificateFile and SSLCACertificatePath are used to both define the trust list for client authentication and create the list of CA distinguished names for the CertificateRequest message. By adding a new directive to mod_ssl (SSLCADNRequestPath, SSLCADNRequestFile) that, only when present, will specifically define the set of certificates to derive the client_CA distinguished names in the exact same way as SSLCACertificate*. In this case SSLCACertificate* will only define the trust list. When not present, SSLCACertificate* does double duty as normal. This makes the fix downwardly compatible with existing SSL configurations.

Here's an example, tested on 2.0.52 on two different Linux servers:   <!--#set var='HTTP_COOKIE' value='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=n' -->  Your HTTP_COOKIE is:  '<!--#echo var='HTTP_COOKIE' -->'  <!--#if expr='$HTTP_COOKIE = /(.+)/' --> ...but captured from a regex using (.+), it's truncated to this:  '<!--#echo var='1' -->' <!--#endif -->   In case this form/webpage messes with that code, just visit this URL:  http://nodivisions.com/test.shtml  Note that the actual value of HTTP_COOKIE doesn't matter; I found this bug while using 3 real cookie values in it, but then replaced them with all Xes to test.  Only the length seems to matter.

33170	null	RESOLVED		Rici Lake	1106175420000	1107476362000		ProxyRemoteMatch uses remote proxy if regex does *not* match The ProxyRemoteMatch directive is supposed to use a regex to redirect certain proxy requests to a  remote proxy server (as I understand the documentation). I actually needed that for a configuration (see  below) and was puzzled to find that it doesn't work: (line numbers from APACHE_2_0_BRANCH, because  I can't find a web interface to svn.)  389 :  p2 = ap_strchr_c(ents[i].scheme, ':');  /* is it a partial URL? */ 390 :  if (strcmp(ents[i].scheme, '*') == 0 || 391 :      (ents[i].use_regex && ap_regexec(ents[i].regexp, url, 0,NULL, 0)) || 392 :      (p2 == NULL && strcasecmp(scheme, ents[i].scheme) == 0) || 393 :      (p2 != NULL && 394 :       strncasecmp(url, ents[i].scheme, strlen(ents[i].scheme)) == 0)) {  ap_regexec returns 0 on success, so the condition in line 391 matches if the regex didn't match, which  is the reverse of the expected behaviour. Changing line 391 to  391 :      (ents[i].use_regex && ap_regexec(ents[i].regexp, url, 0,NULL, 0) == 0) ||  produced the expected behaviour.  This code seems to have been unchanged since the directive was introduced in 2.0.35, almost three  years ago, and I cannot find any relevant bug reports; in fact, googling for ProxyRemoteMatch did not  yield any indication that anyone has ever tried to use the directive, much less succeeded.

33508	null	RESOLVED		Mike Brown	1108081860000	1185884276000		folder images missing from small icons Symptom: broken folder image in directory index when using the small icon set. Probably affects all Apache versions (I am initially filing this report for just the version I have, though: 2.0.52).  Cause: When the small icon set was added, dir.gif was included, but its identical twin, folder.gif, was not. folder.gif is needed by the FancyIndexer, due to the presence of 'AddIcon /icons/folder.gif ^^DIRECTORY^^' in the default httpd.conf.  Reproduction: In your httpd.conf, in the 'Aliases' section, put  Alias /icons/ '/usr/local/www/icons-dist/small/' <Directory '/usr/local/www/icons-dist/small'>     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all </Directory>  Elsewhere in httpd.conf, make sure the IndexOptions line has FancyIndexing, IconWidth=16, and IconHeight=16. Then do a graceful restart, and use a browser to access a directory that would be subject to indexing and that contains a subdirectory. Observe the broken image next to the subdirectory.  Solution: Either add copies of dir.gif & dir.png to the Apache distribution as folder.gif and folder.png, or do whatever is needed to ensure that copies get created at install time.  Thanks!  - Mike <mike@hyperreal.org> (original contributor of the small icon set)	Changed summary to improve searchability Several years later...  I just renamed dir to folder in trunk, since dir is never used. I don't see any urgency to backport this, since few people use the small icons and it is easy enough to fix in the config.

I traced its execution and noticed that it actually tries to create the file with full 07777 permissions, but the FreeBSD kernel ignores sticky, because it's a regular file.  In htdigest.c is a call to apr_file_open() for the digest file, with -1 in the perm argument.  htpasswd, which uses APR_OS_DEFAULT for the perm argument, creates its files with proper permissions.	Hmm, I'd guess your APR headers are outdated (i.e. not matching the lib version). Could this be? (In reply to comment #1) > Hmm, I'd guess your APR headers are outdated (i.e. not matching the lib > version). Could this be?  I don't think so. One, I installed the whole thing from the FreeBSD ports collection, and the APR headers are in the same package as the server, and two, the bug doesn't have anything to do with a wrong #define. In support/htdigest.c, even in HEAD, there is a call to apr_file_open() with -1 as fourth argument. Not something that's #defined to -1, but a literal -1.  APR_OS_DEFAULT (what htpasswd uses instead) is 07777, but it's special-cased in libapr to use 00666. Good catch!

This does not happen on every request -- I have a script running to continuously pump requests with random ID/password into the server from a pool of 5000 LDAP objects so I can fill the cache.  I can get generally 1 failure in every 100 requests until it starts purging the cache, then that number increases to approximately 1 in 10.  This is not acceptable for production website so I have eliminated the issue by using ldap-attribute instead of group for now.  I can see where there is the possibility of having a NULL payload in the cache  due to a node copy unable to succeed because of memory allocation issues, but  I am unable to duplicate this problem on either NetWare or SUSE Linux.  Adding  a NULL check in the node free routine couldn't hurt.    There are a couple of problems that I see with the example configuration.   First, are member and/or uniquemember attributes of the group object public?   If not then all of your accesses will probably fail anyway unless you  configure a username and password for util_ldap to use when accessing ldap.   Also, there isn't a base context defined in the ldap url.  Was this just a  typo?  Anyway, with or without the mis-configuration, I am still unable to  duplicate the problem.  yes, sorry, there's a base context in the 'real' LDAP URL ... Everything does work correctly -most- of the time.  The 2nd set of stack dumps (where it dumps in util_ldap_search_node_compare) is the most recent set of problems I am having.  I can replicate the intermittent crash (~ 1 out of 20) every time I use a 'require group cn=foo,o=bar' and it crashes every time in the same function (see above.)  And every time the stack trace via gdb seems to have corruption in the arguments to the util_ldap_cache_checkuserid function.  I have tested this with thousands of requests with random IDs from a pool, to stress both the cache filling and purging.  It seems to not exhibit crashy behavior until after the first purge.  If you'd like any additional information, I can replicate this easily, and would be happy to provide any other debugging information you need to examine this more fully.  Using prefork, by the way, if that matters.  (Was debugging with single thread, still got the crash.)   This is what happens when LDAPSharedCacheSize is too small and the out of memory condition is not handled well.  There's no error or anything returned by the calloc functions.  I suspect it's a problem in Solaris only, if no one can replicate this on any other OS.  From reading past bug reports it seems the shared memory code on Solaris is problematic at best, anyway.  Increasing LDAPSharedCacheSize to a reasonably high value that will not be exceeded during regular webserver activity has made this problem go away. I think this error condition should be handled. A Crash is not acceptable to me. This Problem is reproducible in Redhat AS 2.1.  It is a little bit difficult to determine 'a reasonably high value' of  LDAPSharedCacheSize. But I think the default value of  LDAPSharedCacheSize '100KB' is too small for the default of  LDAPCacheEntries '1024'.  Maybe it would be helpful if the default settings in the documentation didn't reflect a 200k cache size with 1024 entries?  I have mine set to 1024000 with 512 entries and 120 second timeouts and have just ran 40,000 test hits against the cache with no failures.   Created an attachment (id=15811) fix cache corruption with full cache  This patch fixes the cache corruption at full cache for me. Joe,  We have loaded tested with this patch applied and it appears to have fixed the cache corruption problem  for us as well. Good to hear, Ryan.  This has been committed to the trunk and submitted for backport to 2.0.x.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=225746&view=rev  Note that there is at least one other bug I know if in the current 2.0.x code which could cause cache corruption; the fact that the mutex protecting the shm segment is not initialized properly (see r105412).  I'll be proposing that for backport too.

These are in ESTABLISHED state for the duration  of the keep-alive timeout period. Then they enter CLOSE_WAIT state, where they  stay for a few seconds. If the user tries to go to a new page AND 'friendly  http error messages' is enabled in Internet Explorer, the infamous 'The page  cannot be displayed' appears.  This has been reproduced with httpd 2.0.52 and 2.0.53 with OpenSSL 0.9.7b,  0.9.7d and 0.9.7g. We were not able to reproduce the bug in 2.0.40 or 2.0.47  (all config files were equal), which makes us believe some sort of bug or  incampability with Explorer is introduced some time after 2.0.47. One will have  to go via a proxy in order to reproduce it.  For performance reasons, it is not an option to disable keep-alive.  Disabling SSLv3 'fixes' the problem.	There have been a couple of reports like this recently.  Do you have a precise reproduction case with a specific version of MSIE, which only triggers in those particular httpd versions?  What's logged to the error log for the SSL vhost?  Anyway, the default SSL vhost configuration will disable keepalives for MSIE for the SSL vhost, using the SetEnvIf below; I take it you have disabled this?  SetEnvIf User-Agent '.*MSIE.*' /          nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown /          downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0  Please also include the full SSL configuration you're using, Created an attachment (id=14715) SSL configuration  For performance reasons (throughput was halfed without keep-alive) the default  SetEnvIf has been disabled. As 95% of our users use IE, it is not an option to  use this setting.  We tried to include just SetEnvIf User-Agent '.*MSIE.*' ssl-unclean-shutdown,  but it did not fix the problem.  We have also tried to run without mod_deflate, but that didn't help either.  My full IE version is 6.0.2800.1106.xpsp2_gdr.040517-1325CO with updates  Q323308, Q832894, Q837009 and Q867801. We have received error reports from  users with different versions, though.  The full SSL config file is now attached (virtual section included). Nothing is logged in the ssl logs on the server. In fact I don't think the  request reaches the server at all, as Explorer seems to try to use a connection  that is in CLOSE_WAIT state. One could argue that this seems like an Explorer  bug, but as we easily reproduce this problem in 2.0.52/53 and not in 40/47,  some unfortunate change seems to have been introduced after 47. OK, more things it would be useful to try:  1. MSIE can be sensitive to session caching; try switching to the SSLSessionCache shmcb:... line  2. it would be useful to narrow down where the regression occurs; particularly, if it works with 2.0.48 and fails with 2.0.49, that's useful; there was a significant change to the SSL connection closure handling there, but it shouldn't take effect if you have ssl-unclean-shutdown configured for *MSIE*.  3. get some useful logs; add to the SSL vhost config:  LogLevel debug ErrorLog logs/ssl_debug_log  and attach the resultant ssl_debug_log showing the reproduction of the failure (or better yet; a before-and-after with a version which works and one which doesn't) Created an attachment (id=14724) SSL debug log from 2.0.40 (no error)  Performed the following steps: 1.

I have uploaded some log files from 2.0.52 and 2.0.40.  If you still need more info I can try to narrow down where the problem occurs  in a few days. I have now verified that the error is reproducable in 2.0.49 but not in 2.0.48.   I looked at the code and it seems the problem is that ssl-unclean-shutdown is  ignored.  If you change the default: behaviour in the switch in ssl_filter_io_shutdown()  in ssl_engine_io.c to unclean the problem disappears.  I guess sslconn->shutdown_type should be set by ssl_configure_env in  ssl_engine_kernel.c, but it seems like this function is not run at all. I don't  know the httpd architecture well enough to find why not.  The reason it worked in 2.0.48 is that the block  else if (AP_BUCKET_IS_EOC(bucket)) {             /* The special 'EOC' bucket means a shutdown is needed;              * - turn off buffering in bio_filter_out_write              * - issue the SSL_shutdown              */             filter_ctx->nobuffer = 1;             status = ssl_filter_io_shutdown(filter_ctx, f->c, 0);             if (status != APR_SUCCESS) {                 ap_log_error(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_INFO, status, NULL,                              'SSL filter error shutting down I/O');             }             if ((status = ap_pass_brigade(f->next, bb)) != APR_SUCCESS) {                 return status;             }             break;         }  was inserted in ssl_io_filter_output in ssl_engine_io.c.  Does this make sense? That does make perfect sense, I was wondering whether that might be the issue.  But we now need to work out why the shutdown_type is not getting set; I'll try some tests here.  Thanks a lot! Ugh, yes.  ssl_configure_env is called from mod_ssl's ssl_hook_Translate, but that won't run if, e.g. mod_proxy's translate_name hook is run first and returns OK, as happens in the reverse-proxy case.  I have no idea why that section of mod_ssl code needs to be in a translate_name hook, it's probably historical.  If it can be moved somewhere more sensible this will work. Created an attachment (id=14750) proposed mod_ssl fix  Here's a patch which should fix this; it moves the ssl_configure_env call to the post_read_request hook, and runs said hook slightly later to ensure that it runs later than the mod_setenvif post_read_request hook (a quick hack for testing purposes, I'll do better when committing this).  Patch should apply against 2.0.5[34]-ish. Created an attachment (id=14804) equivalent patch for 2.0.x backport proposal  This patch is to be proposed for backport to 2.0.x and is essentially equivalent to the previous patch. Fixed on the trunk: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?view=rev&rev=161958 and proposed for backport to 2.0.x.  Thanks again for your help debugging this issue! Does anybody know whether or not this fix was incorporated in the 2.2 tree?     We recently upgraded from 2.0.48 to 2.2.0 and are now seeing a similiar issue  to what's reported here.   Let me know if you require additional information.   This patch is also contained in 2.2.0. *** Bug 20641 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Davi Arnaut	Eirik Gjesteland	Joe Orton	Richard	Ruediger Pluem

(In reply to comment #1) > But that would break nph-scripts, wouldn't it? I have just removed the second 3 lines leaving the first 4 lines intact. I have  tested that with nph scripts. It works. This ensures that nph scripts get just  the filename and the others get the whole path.  So the code is  --------------- conf = ap_get_module_config(r->server->module_config, &cgid_module);     is_included = !strcmp(r->protocol, 'INCLUDED');      if ((argv0 = strrchr(r->filename, '/')) != NULL)         argv0++;     else         argv0 = r->filename;      nph = !(strncmp(argv0, 'nph-', 4));  -    if ((argv0 = strrchr(r->filename, '/')) != NULL) -        argv0++; -    else         argv0 = r->filename;      if (!(ap_allow_options(r) & OPT_EXECCGI) && !is_scriptaliased(r))         return log_scripterror(r, conf, HTTP_FORBIDDEN, 0,                                'Options ExecCGI is off in this directory');     if (nph && is_included)         return log_scripterror(r, conf, HTTP_FORBIDDEN, 0,                                'attempt to include NPH CGI script');  ------------------------------------------------     Yes, this behavior was broken between mod_cgi and mod_cgid, because the   developer hadn't noted that we -tested- argv0 in mod_cgi, but then passed   argv[0] for the creation call, and therefore assumed the short name was   the argv[0] argument.    Fixed in SVN trunk, and proposed for backport.    			Andr?? Malo	Pradeep Kumar S	Will Rowe

We are having the same problem with Microsoft Active Directory Service (Windows  2000), we don't use OpenLDAP.  We did the patch on 2.0.54 but didn't help. So we're looking for a Windows 2000  bug now?  Is this bug closed because it works with OpenLDAP server? Can anyone else test  on Windows 2000?

For example:  string ''c://temp//'' SHOULD be parsed as 'c://temp//' but CURRENTLY it is parsed as 'c://temp//''  The example shows that the function interprets the last quotation mark as forced (instead of as the end of the string) because of the preceding backslash. I think this behaviour would be OK if there were only one backslash at the end of the string but in the case of two backslashes the last quotation mark should NOT be forced to remain in the function result string.

35211	null	RESOLVED		Paul Querna	1117830960000	1118716799000		RFE: Better support for Vary Headers in mod_cache Currently, mod_cache is RFC compliant in its handling of Vary headers, but it behaves in a less than optimal manner.  If a reply contains the vary header, it is noted.  If the varied headers match in both the stored version and the client request, the cache is used. If the varied headers are missing or do not match, the cached copy is not used.  When the cached copy is not used, a new version is fetched from the backend, and replaces the previously cached copy, that contained different values for the Varied headers.  This effectively kills the cache hit rate when using the Vary header, since anytime a header does vary the cached copy is destroyed.  The enhancement would be storing one copy of the page, for every Varied header value/combination.  One possible solution is to include the Varied headers in the Cache Hash.  This would give each combination of varied headers, values and URLs their own unique hash, and would enable the current mod_disk_cache and mod_mem_cache to operate with little or no changes.  The problem is that we do not know if a URL should be varied, until after we have already determined the Cache Hash.  If this route is taken, some method to change the cache hash at a later time might be needed.  Another possible solution, that would require changes to both mod_mem_cache, mod_disk_cache, and htcacheclean, would be to make some knid of 'index' node.  This node would contain a list of all known combinations for each varied header, and the location of the cached version of each.	Fixed in trunk.  Went with modifiying the .headers file format to include a new 'Vary Headers' format.			Paul Querna

We found out that starting with apache version 2.0.49, the behavior of Apache  (2.0.49 up to 2.0.54 )running with mod_ssl and OPenSSL/0.9.7g is changed after  the reception of a [RST, ACK] packet from Internet Explorer 6.0.  This problem does not happen with 2.0.47 and 2.0.48.  The impact is an increase packets transmitted and communication delays when  this behavior starts.   1. Expected Behavior. Apache/OPenSSL use as a Proxy to WebLogic  When we start Apache, and request a page (IE 6.0) using this kind of URL:  https://mvperf1/jmsproxy/1KBytesR.jsp, we can see that the response is  returned as a single SSL packet as shown here.

But turns out that it only performs up to 15 reads of (at most) 512 bytes.	Created an attachment (id=15353) Patch that fixes the problem.  This patch fixes the issue and 2 warnings I got with -Wall on apr_shutdown and apr_recv not being declared. apr_shutdown should be part of apr_compat.h.  The submitted patch is against the 2.0.x branch, not trunk. This was mentioned on http-wg a while ago, indeed.  Does the current behaviour actually cause practical problems?  The change introduces an extra gettimeofday() call into the normal processing of every request so it needs good justification. I found this out because I was sending a POST of a few MB to a web service, but I got the url wrong and saw that there were 15 small reads when closing before i got the RST when trying to read from the socket. OK, there are a few alternatives here:  - take the hit on the uncommon path where the read() doesn't get EOF first time through, and keep calling read()/apr_time_now() until 30 seconds have *really* passed  pro: equally as safe as 1.3 code con: more overhead  - bump the tmp buffer size to 8K and lower the read() timeout to 1 second.  this way the server could eat 30*8K=245K bytes without additional overhead, giving a significantly better chance of getting the response to the client than just 15*512=~7K  pro: little more overhead than current 2.0 code con: still less safe than 1.3 If there's anything I can say, I'd go for the first alternative and linger for at most ~32s, while not incurring in any additional penalty for the common path. The reason that such code isn't in there now is to avoid all the syscalls (retrieving the time).  Some cleverness may allow an implementation that is willing to wait longer (close to MAX_SECS_TO_LINGER) without retrieving the time so much. Created an attachment (id=15375) Second attempt. Patch against http-2.0.x  How about this? There are no calls to time() involved. The first read polls for up to 30s and subsequent ones only for 0.5s, with a limit on the maximum number of reads that doubles the maximum read length existing now. Oops. Forgot to increment nread_ops in the loop. I don't see how that implementation actually fixes the problem.  Or am I missing something fundamental?  The *problem* is that the server is not reading enough bytes from the socket to eat up the TCP window and prevent an RST from allowing the client to see the response.  Just changing the timeouts makes no difference, the solution needs to actually increase the number of read() calls made (and/or increase the buffer size passed to read).  In the situation which lingering close is helping, the first read call is *not* going to time out; the TCP receive buffer for this socket on the server will already be non-empty so it will necessarily return data immediately.  Changing that first timeout just introduces a new problem; if the client disappears completely after reading the response, the server will now hang around for thirty seconds waiting for a FIN that will never arrive, rather than just for two seconds.  Fixed on trunk and back-ported for 2.1.8 and later.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=291452&view=rev *** Bug 17722 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Gonzalo Paniagua Javier	Jeff Trawick	Joe Orton	Paul Querna

36090	null	RESOLVED		Chris Darroch	1123557420000	1134133220000		CGI Status: header triggers recursive ErrorDocument handling If a CGI script outputs a Status: header with a value other than 200, and then generates malformed headers, the message that is returned to the client includes the bogus statement that 'Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request' even if no ErrorDocument directives are present in the server configuration files.  For example, with no ErrorDocuments defined, the following Perl CGI script:  #!/usr/bin/perl print 'Status: 404/n'; print 'FOO/n/n';  produces this HTML output:  Internal Server Error The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request. ... Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.  This bug occurs with both Apache 1.3 and 2.x (it was tested using 1.3.33 and 2.1.6-alpha).  The source of the problem appears to be in ap_process_request() in modules/http/http_request.c.  I will follow up this bug report with a proposed patch which addresses the issue described below.  The ap_process_request() function is used by the main 'process_connection' hook functions in modules/http/http_core.c.  The ap_process_request() function calls ap_invoke_handler(), which calls ap_run_handler(), which invokes the correct 'handler' hook function for a given request.  In the case of a request that maps to a CGI script, this is either cgi_handler() or cgid_handler() in modules/generators/mod_cgi.c or mod_cgid.c, respectively.  Those 'handler' hook functions both use ap_scan_script_header_err_brigade() to parse the HTTP headers output by a CGI script.  That function is a wrapper around ap_scan_script_header_err_core() in server/util_script.c, which does the actual parsing.  If ap_scan_script_header_err_core() sees a valid Status: header line in the script's output, it sets r->status accordingly.  However, it may then encounter an error, for example, if it finds a malformed HTTP header.  In the case of the sample CGI script shown above, the 'FOO' header line causes cgi_handler() or cgid_handler() to receive back an HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR return code from ap_scan_script_header_err_brigade().  They pass that back through their local log_script() function (in mod_cgi.c or mod_cgid.c) to ap_run_handler(), which passes it back through ap_invoke_handler() to ap_process_request().  When ap_process_request() does not receive OK or DONE fro ap_invoke_handler() it calls ap_die(), also in modules/http/http_request.c. The ap_die() function is called from various places, mostly in the modules/http/* and modules/proxy/* code, in order to terminate the current request.  It determines whether an ErrorDocument directive exists for a given error code; if one does and it maps to a local URL (beginning with a leading / character), then it performs an internal redirection using ap_internal_redirect() in the same file. If the sub-request that is generated causes another error, then ap_die() will be called recursively.  When this occurs, ap_internal_redirect() needs to back out of the situation, use the default error message for the original error code, and amend it with a note about the secondary error code from the internal redirection.  To do this, it examines r->status for a value other than HTTP_OK; if another value is found, then ap_die() assumes that it has been called from within a failing internal redirection for an ErrorDocument directive with a local URL.  It then recovers the initial request data, prevents any handling of customized error messages with ErrorDocument directives, and calls ap_send_error_response() in modules/http/http_protocol.c with its recursive_error parameter set. This function is responsible for sending back the appropriate error message to the client, along with the additional information about the recursive_error parameter.  The problem described in this bug report occurs because if r->status has been set to a value other than HTTP_OK by ap_scan_script_header_err_core() -- or any other function invoked during request handling -- then ap_die() treats that as a signal that a recursive error is in progress, although this is not true.  The proposed patch amends the ap_process_request() function by resetting r->status to HTTP_OK just before calling ap_die().  No changes are made to ap_internal_redirect() or ap_internal_redirect_handler() in the same modules/http/http_request.c file, although they have similar blocks of code.  This is because these functions are used in various places to perform internal redirections, copying most of the original request's data, including its r->status value.  This includes ap_die() itself, which uses ap_internal_redirect() to handle local URLs in ErrorDocument directives.  The assumption is therefore made that any caller of these two internal redirection functions knows that the r->status value of the initial request has an appropriate value (i.e., HTTP_OK) before invoking them. If this is not true, then other similar bugs may exist elsewhere in the code; however, a quick scan suggests that some users of these functions do this.  For example, asis_handler() in modules/generators/mod_asis.c resets r->status to HTTP_OK before calling ap_internal_redirect_handler().  The mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules seem to perform explicit checks for r->status == HTTP_OK before using these functions.  The modules/arch/win32/mod_isapi.c file along with mod_rewrite.c, mod_actions.c, and mod_negotiation.c in modules/mappers might all be examined to determine if r->status could be a value other than HTTP_OK prior to their use of these functions, since if these functions detect an error and call ap_die(), then ap_die() will think it is handling a recursive error, as is the case with this particular bug.

This is documented in the Debian BTS (http://bugs.debian.org) as bug #323785 (http://bugs.debian.org/323785).  The issue was discussed in the #apache channel on IRC, and it was concluded that the reason for the segfault is that cgid is unable to access the memory region where mod_vhost_ldap keeps its module_config structure -- or any other module_config structure for that matter. For suExec, there is special magic in mod_cgid that allows its configuration to be passed through the unix socket so that cgid can use it. However, adding such special cases for every module that needs them is not really a good way to solve the problem.  So a more generic way of letting mod_cgid access is needed. When discussing the issue on IRC, colmmacc suggested that there is a more correct way implemented in os/unix/unixd.c.	Not quite on the unixd.c, but there is a more correct way of doing this within cgid, working on it now.

Furthermore, the documentation lists the following for 'RewriteOptions': 'inherit     This forces the current configuration to inherit the configuration of the parent. In per-virtual-server context this means that the maps, conditions and rules of the main server are inherited. In per-directory context this means that conditions and rules of the parent directory's .htaccess configuration are inherited.'  This says that the 'configuration' is inherited, which seems to mean only a 'RewriteOptions inherit' is needed in each vhost to inherit all settings.  In practice, you also need a 'RewriteEngine On' for each vhost. This should be mentioned somewhere.  Additionally one could wonder if a 'RewriteEngine On' would be neccesary at all in each vhost, but that is beside the point here :-)	Several years later... Thanks, I've improved the documentation on this point by adding a separate section discussing it.			Joshua Slive

'tomcat2' is the route set in jvmRoute in the Engine element in server.xml.   I expected that mod_proxy_balancer would match its path argument against the part after the . from JSESSIONID, but it tries to match against the whole cookie and fails obviousely. (in httpd-2.1.6-alpha/modules/proxy/mod_proxy_balancer.c, find_route_worker function)  That way, balancer is useless as a replacement for mod_jk load balancing with sticky sessions.

It does. As you can choose the name of the cookie you can make any application where you can set a cookie work with that. Just set cookie BLAH=a.route in your application. Of course it is more convenient if the application container is able to do this (like Tomcat). BTW: I know no standard for coding such routing information inside a cookie. But if you know one I would be interested to get it known.			Christoph Bachhuber-Haller	R??diger Pl??m	Ruediger Pluem

OK, so let's bypass the 302 and go directly to http://tomcat/admin/.  The  initial GET works with either protocol, e.g., with AJP:   # wget http://tomcat/admin/  --01:10:06--  http://tomcat/admin/             => "index.html.1'  Resolving tomcat... 127.0.0.1  Connecting to tomcat|127.0.0.1|:80... connected.

The difference is readily apparent.  The images, stylesheets,  etc., are served up with HTTP, but not with AJP.	If you bring up the same stock configurations described above, you can also  reproduce the redirect to HTTPS problem by accessing http://tomcat/tomcat-docs. I can reproduce the problem with 5.5.12 (and httpd 2.0.8) as well, so since  from the lack of response no one in tomcat-dev appears to care about problems  with 5.0.x, I'm modifying the record to show that it effects the current  development branch, too.

It seems that the problem is that mod_proxy_ajp isn't playing nice with  mod_ssl (so that this is really a Httpd bug).  Even when the connection isn't  HTTPS, mod_proxy_ajp is sending (empty) SSL attributes like cipher, client- cert, session-id.  This causes Tomcat to believe that the request was recieved  on HTTPS, so it redirects accordingly.

Created an attachment (id=16619) Patch against Tomcat 5.5.9  After doing some further tests and further analysis I must revert my earlier assumption that this is a httpd bug. It rather seems that org.apache.ajp.RequestHandler does not honour the isSSL bit inside an ajp message correctly. Attached is a patch against Tomcat 5.5.9 that should fix this. Hi,  I must dissagree with you. The bug has nothing to do with Tomcat. Tomcat works pretty well with mod_jk w or w/o SSL.  The error is obviously in mod_proxy_ajp. Mladen is insisting that the problem is with mod_proxy_ajp, so he'll veto the patch. Unfortunately, he's quite busy right now, so more comments later.  It also seems to me that it is a mod_proxy_ajp bug if it sends bogus HTTPS related headers if this isn't actually using HTTPS.

The first patch of mod_proxy_ajp is sub-optimal, but will work.  It would be  better if mod_proxy_ajp honored the is_ssl flag and didn't bother to check the  SSL attributes unless it was set.  Your patch of Tomcat isn't even worth vetoing, since the patched class doesn't  exist in 5.5.x, and is deprecated in 4.1.x.  Play watch the bouncing bug ;-). Created an attachment (id=16620) Fix for mod_proxy_ajp's SSL attributes  This fixes mod_proxy_ajp handling of SSL attributes.  Not only does it stop it from sending garbage to Tomcat, but it doesn't even bother with the lookup unless the request came in on SSL.  And, as a bonus feature, it even gets the key-size working again.  Someday, mod_proxy_ajp may be almost as good as mod_jk ;-). Apart from a few minor style issues the patch looks good to me. Thanks. It removes the problem I saw with my first version of the patch which did not fix it correctly. What still worries me a little bit is the comment above the key_size block, which says 'added support only in ajp14 mode'. Maybe I am just misreading this comment, but could someone of the AJP gurus confirm that this attribute is also valid in AJP13? (In reply to comment #13) > misreading this comment, but could someone of the AJP gurus confirm that this > attribute is also valid in AJP13?  All current release versions of Tomcat support it, and any older ones will  ignore an attribute that they don't recognize.

Agreed, but I am not sure if the AJP connector on Tomcat side should set isSSL to true once it finds some of the SSL variables in the AJP message. From my point of view it should also ignore all SSL variables in the message if isSSL is set to false in the message.			Mladen Turk	Noel J.

When trying to access http://mybalancer.local.org/Test the internal servers are balanced/proxied but the request arriving at them has been rewritten to '/test/'!!	Created an attachment (id=16777) Patch against trunk  Could you please give the attached patch a try? It should fix your problem. Nope, only partially: The case of the leading 'T' is no longer changed to lower case, but the trailing slash is still appended. The internal application does not handle that. It expects to see '/Test', not '/Test/'. This problem is caused by a configuration flaw on your side. Please use the following configuration instead:  <Proxy balancer://mycluster>     BalancerMember 'http://10.1.2.10:4321' retry=10 loadfactor=1     BalancerMember 'http://10.1.2.11:4321' retry=10 loadfactor=1 </Proxy> ProxyPass /Test balancer://mycluster/Test lbmethod=byrequests That does not seem sensible to me - and it also does not work. Using your config my backend servers see only '/' as URL.  And if you were right I believe I could not do sth. like this - which would be a major drawback in my eyes:  <Proxy balancer://mycluster>     BalancerMember 'http://10.1.2.10:4321/Test1' retry=10 loadfactor=1     BalancerMember 'http://10.1.2.11:4321/Path/to/Test2' retry=10 loadfactor=1 </Proxy> ProxyPass /MyTest balancer://mycluster/Test lbmethod=byrequests  Correct me if I??m wrong... Have to correct myself: the config you proposed _does_ work. Should??ve been more accurate when testing it....  The second part of my comment, however, still applies: if things work like you say one cannot have different paths on the backend servers. Sometimes this would come in very handy.  On the other hand: if things work like you say, the majority of cases should be covered.  Perhaps the docs could be enhanced to better describe the way the configuration works. Adding the path to the BalancerMember parameter seemed quite natural to me since the port to be used on the respective backend is given there - so why not the path also?!  Anyway: thanks for your effort and thanks for mod_proxy_balancer: it is a powerfull enrichment for the httpd!  Ok, you got me :-). Of course your second comment is completely valid and it does not seem to be logical why your configuration does not work, but mine does. So I try to explain what happens:  The right side of a ProxyPass side will be normalized. Your configuration contains the URL balancer://mycluster. This gets normalized to balancer://mycluster/ which is correct, as the URL should consist of <scheme>://<host><uri>. If uri is empty it is assumed to be '/'. On the other hand when creating the final proxy URL from a balancer member the approach is:  <balancer member><uri of right side of ProxyPass><path after left side of ProxyPass in request>  In your case this means e.g.  http://10.1.2.11:4321/Test (balancer member) + '/' (uri of right side of ProxyPass) + '' (path after left side of ProxyPass in request) = http://10.1.2.11:4321/Test/.  In general this approach is fine and correct. But it makes the following configurations impossible in cases where Test1 and Test2 cannot handle the trailing /:    <Proxy balancer://mycluster>     BalancerMember 'http://10.1.2.10:4321/Test1' retry=10 loadfactor=1     BalancerMember 'http://10.1.2.11:4321/Test2' retry=10 loadfactor=1   </Proxy>   ProxyPass /Test balancer://mycluster lbmethod=byrequests  But after a first glance to the code make this work and keep all other cases working seem to get complicated. So I will  - Mark this bug as fixed close (as your problem is fixed with the patch and the adjusted configuration) - Try to get the patch in 2.1.9 - Keep this in mind and have a look when I have time. I will update this PR once I find a solution for this.

One thing I would like to see added to the documentation is a note stating that mod_dumpio sends its output to the ErrorLog using LogLevel debug. If you have configured your server for LogLevel warn (the default), then DumpIOInput On and DumpIOOutput On will have no effect.

I'd like to help  isolate this.  Please let me know what I can do.    Using Apache as a caching-proxy.

Output from make and  httpd.conf available as;  http://citiperk.net/make_out.txt http://citiperk.net/make_err.txt http://citiperk.net/httpd.conf.txt  This problem came up while we were adding people to the proxy for the first  time, trying to see how it would perform with more than just me.  It worked  fine, but I would occasionally find a runaway process after a day or two of it  being up.    I can now reliably reproduce the problem by requesting a secure page and  closing the browser before the page can complete. I am not able to break it by  requesting non-secure pages.   With the processes spun up I looked at netstat.  There appeared to be three  connections from the proxy to the content still open.

I guess http://httpd.apache.org/dev/debugging.html#gdb could be useful for you to further debug the problem. It would be nice to have stacktrace of the runaway process to get an idea what goes wrong.

(System is a Netra T1/AC200 with a 500mhz Ultrasparc IIi  CPU)  It's a minor problem, as the server continues, and it correctly links my IP  Virtual SSL sites to their correct certificates without any problems, it  appears to just be a logging issue.  If I switch to a 32bit build, then there is no problem, the SSL warning is  gone, and everything works fine, but I wish to use the 64bit build to get  around the STDIO limit of 255 open files that Solaris has.	It would be helpful if you can post your ssl and virtual host configuration here. Thanks, here is the ssl.conf file I am using to test the 64bit build, its a  copy from our of our 'production' servers which are currently on a 32bit build  of Apache 2.0.54, I've xxx'ed out part of the pathnames as they appear on the  production server, but apart from that the config file is 'as is'  Building the same source tree in 32 bit resolves the warning, but as soon as I  compile into 64bit I have the problem.   My configure is / ./configure --enable-modules=most --enable-mods-shared=all --enable-so -- enable-ssl=/usr/local/ssl --enable-ssl=shared --enable-suexec --with-suexec- caller=xxx --with-suexec-docroot=/xxx/xxx --with-suexec- logfile=/var/log/suexec.cgi.log  When compiling with GCC, in 64bit, im using CFLAGS=-mcpu=ultrasparc -m64 -O3,  and with Sun Studio im using CFLAGS=-Xa -xtarget=ultra2 -xarch=v9a -xvis -xO4 - xspace -xdepend  Both compilers successfully build both the 32bit, and 64bit versions, both the  GCC and Sun CC 32 bit builds have no errors in the error_log, but the GCC and  Sun CC 64bit builds both exhibit the same warnings in the error_log.  As I reported initialy the server continues to startup after the warning, and  the SSL sites are functioning 100%, with the correct certificate attached to  the sites as I would expect.  Apart from this one warning in the error_log, the 64bit build is performing  spectacularly well, on identical 500mhz Netra AC200 servers the 32bit build is  pumping out 350 requests per second according to an AB test on a very simple  static html file, the same test on the 64bit build is giving 400  requests/second.  I initially tested the 64bit build using a production httpd.conf with 200  virtual *:80 NameVirtual hosts, but to simplify testing I replaced it with the  default httpd.conf that is installed after the initial make install, so the  only 'modified' config file is ssl.conf which I have added below.     #    CustomLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-access_log common  ## ##  SSL Global Context ## ##  All SSL configuration in this context applies both to ##  the main server and all SSL-enabled virtual hosts. ##  # #   Some MIME-types for downloading Certificates and CRLs # AddType application/x-x509-ca-cert .crt AddType application/x-pkcs7-crl    .crl  #   Pass Phrase Dialog: #   Configure the pass phrase gathering process. #   The filtering dialog program ("builtin' is a internal #   terminal dialog) has to provide the pass phrase on stdout.

When you need a different shutdown #   approach you can use one of the following variables: #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown: #     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no #     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates #     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use #     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where #     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert. #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown: #     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a #     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify #     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in #     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use #     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation #     works correctly. #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP #   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable #   keep-alive for those clients, too.

For debugging httpd with gdb please have a look at  http://httpd.apache.org/dev/debugging.html  Please keep in mind to recompile your httpd with gcc and -O2 -g instead of -O3 in this case. You should set a breakpoint at ssl_engine_init.c:1039 via break ssl_engine_init.c:1039 After httpd stopped at this point please issue print key  Background: I think that          key = apr_psprintf(p, '%pA:%u',                            &s->addrs->host_addr, s->addrs->host_port);  in line 1037-1038 of ssl_engine_init.c do not deliver different results for the different virtual host, because apr_psprintf might not correctly format 64 Bit pointers. BTW: Some APR guys listening? Could you guys give a hint on that theory? Nice! You found the buggy code ;) but the reason why is:  %pA takes a 'struct in_addr *' argument, but that's being passed an 'apr_sockaddr_t *' argument.  ...it should be %pI instead. Created an attachment (id=16684) Patch against trunk  Graham could you please give this patch a try and see if this removes your problem? It does what Joe proposed. That isn't quite right, since %pI prints 'address:port' using the port out of the apr_sockaddr_t structure.   I'm not sure even whether that port will be the same as s->addr->host_port - probably not.  If it is, that's OK; need to test that.  There's a further problem that %pI is liable to print corrupt strings with apr_psprintf due to an APR bug (only fixed on the trunk). Created an attachment (id=16685) patch against 2.0.x   Here's an alternative patch which should be slightly safer. Applied Joe's second patch to my 2.0.54 code, and compiled, so far so good, no  errors reported in the error_log now.  Excellent, with my normal config file the error_log is now clean, and just  shows the server starting up. I also ran a test with an invalid SSL  configuration with NameVirtual hosts, and it correctly identified the problem,  and logged it to error_log.    Thanks for the update Graham. Joe, sorry for the misunderstanding and thanks for the update. As far as I can see the problem is also on the trunk and given the apr problem I think we should not rely on apr_psprintf in this point on the trunk too. Do you commit or should I do? Thanks for testing the patch out.  Committed to trunk and 2.2.x; this is probably not worth a backport to 2.0.x since it's only a warning.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=320796&view=rev			Graham Coker	Joe Orton	Ruediger Pluem

Now, when we hit the memory-cached object, mod_disk_cache returns the original 301 response with a replaced HTTP status of 200. This causes clients to not follow the redirect.  I will try to illustrate this:  request:     GET /foo HTTP/1.1     Host: www.foo.tld  1st response, before caching:     HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently     Location: http://www.foo.tld/foo/  subsequent response, on same request:     HTTP/1.1 200 OK     Location: http://www.foo.tld/foo/  => Client ignores Location: header	Created an attachment (id=16870) Patch against 2.0.x branch  This has been fixed in trunk and 2.2.x a while ago (r220038).

Your version is nearly the same as above because  !(sc->enabled && sslconn && (ssl = sslconn->ssl))  is equal to  !sc->enabled || !sslconn || !(ssl == sslconn->ssl)  keep in mind that   ssl = sslconn->ssl  and  ssl == sslconn->ssl  are different things.

37874	null	RESOLVED		Mark Cox	1134408180000	1144762153000		CVE-2005-3352 mod_imap cross-site scripting flaw Summary:  A flaw in the imagemap processing module, mod_imap, in versions of Apache httpd 1.3, 2.0 and 2.2 can in some circumstances cause the referer header to be output without being escaped in HTML.  This could allow an attacker who is able to influence the referer header the ability to do cross-site scripting attacks against sites using mod_imap in a vulnerable configuration.  Impact:   moderate (http://httpd.apache.org/security/impact_levels.html)  Mitigation:  This flaw only affects sites using mod_imap with a map file that contains the 'referer' directive.  In order to exploit this flaw the attacker would need to control the  referer header and therefore would need to entice a victim to visit a URL under the attackers control.  A sucessful cross-site scripting attack using this flaw would be limited to certain browsers.  Firefox and Mozilla browsers for example already escape suspect characters in a URL which blocks this from being exploited.  Solution:  The attached patch ensures that the referer header in mod_imap is escaped and therefore cannot be used as part of a cross-site scripting attack.  Where this patch cannot be used, a temporary solution is to remove the 'referer' directive from any map files.  Verification:  I was able to verify this by constructing a victim site with a vulnerable mod_imap configuration and by constructing a set of scripts on the attacker site.  When the attackers site was visited using the Internet Explorer browser it was able to steal the users private cookies from the victim site.

A build bug in Apache itself would appear totally differently.  httpd.spec is included in httpd-2.2.0.tar.gz which I downloaded from apache.org today. So it is not provided by RedHat. What was really missing on my system was /usr/include/zlib.h (which is provided by zlib-devel on RedHat systems, but exists on other systems). Oops, sorry, httpd.spec does appear in the package.  zlib-devel (indeed  anything-devel) is still a package-manager thing.    What did you say fails?  Is it in configure (in which case that's expected  behaviour) or in make (in which case it's a bug if your configure was  successful)?  When configure came to mod_deflate, it stopped whit this message 'error: mod_deflate has been requested but can not be built due to prerequisite failures' Just before, the check for zlib.h ('checking for zlib library') had failed.

38017	null	RESOLVED		Dick Snippe	1135289340000	1151573072000		mod_cache not working in reverse proxy setup? mod_cache does not serve cached content. We'd like to use mod_cache + mod_disk_cache + mod_proxy + mod_proxy_ajp as a reverse caching proxy. The backend server (tomcat) sets all the right http headers (Expires, Last-Modified) but apache refuses to serve cached content. The same problem also shows up with mod_mem_cache and/or mod_proxy_http Examination shows that entries are inserted into the cache using the hostname '_default_'. I assume this is because of the logic in cache_generate_key_default in modules/cache/cache_storage.c  However, cache lookups are done with the actual hostname. So, apache cannot find the data it inserted on earlier requests.  Our setup is as follows: ./configure --prefix=/software/apache-2.2.0-cache --with-mpm=worker --enable-cache --enable-mem-cache --enable-disk-cache --enable-proxy --enable-proxy-http --enable-proxy-ajp --enable-proxy-balancer --enable-rewrite --enable-mods-shared=all  The relevant bits in the config file are: ProxyPreserveHost       On CacheDefaultExpire      60 CacheMaxExpire          3600 CacheIgnoreCacheControl On CacheIgnoreNoLastMod    On CacheEnable             disk    / CacheRoot               /e/fp/shrd02/tmp/cache ProxyPass               /       ajp://shrd01as:8009/ ProxyPassReverse        /       ajp://shrd01as:8009/  BTW: we use apache-2.0.X mod_mem_cache extensively. In the 2.0.X instances caching works, so I'm quite surprised to encounter problems in 2.2. I assume I must be doing something wrong, but can't figure out what.

It seems that If-Match and If-None-Match in general aren't evaluated properly when the target does not exist.  For instance:  LOCK /unmapped If-Match: '*'  should fail with 412, but creates the lock.  Or  LOCK /unmapped If-None-Match: '*'  should succeed, but fails with 412.  Created an attachment (id=19658) test cases for LOCK request with if-* headers  Isn't there any programmer somewhere to help fix this bug. It is a *severe* bug in mod_dav and it is open for at least four years, while IIS does it right.  Created an attachment (id=20552) Fixes If-Match: * and If-None-Match: * bug for mod_dav  The bug is in function ap_meets_conditions() in modules/http/http_protocol.c: it always evaluates 'If-Match: *' to TRUE (is FALSE, if resource does not exist) and 'If-None-Match: *' to FALSE (is TRUE, if the resource does not exist). This function is called by mod_dav, function dav_validate_request(). In this case, ap_meets_conditions() seems not able to get etag reliably (probably a bug in mod_dav). Fix: A new function dav_meets_conditions() is created in modules/dav/main/util.c. It is mostly a copy of ap_meets_conditions(), but fixes the mentioned errors. dav_validate_request() calls dav_meets_conditions() instead of ap_meets_conditions(). ToDo: it would be better to fix this in ap_meets_conditions(). But to do this, this functions must know, whether the resource exists, and it must be able to reliably get the etag of the resource. But as I am not familiar with Apache-programming, I can't do this. I even doubt that it is possible without changes in other Apache modules besides mod_dav.  Created an attachment (id=20553) Test results for conditional LOCK-requests  HTTP-body and irrelevant headers are removed. Clients should remove 'W/' from weak Etags. Apache always creates weak Etags, when a request is sent within less than 1 second after the last modification. So clients that use HEAD to get the Etag immediately after PUT will be fooled when they use this Etag some seconds later. Why would a client remove the weakness indicator?  If the server wants to make x and W/x match, it needs to implement Etag matching that way. But clients should treat etags as opaque strings. IMHO.  > Why would a client remove the weakness indicator? Because the weakness indicator sent by Apache is nonsense.  When I send a PUT request and immediately thereafter send a HEAD request, I always get a weak Etag from Apache, say W/'19e60b-20-279033c0'. If I do the HEAD request some seconds later, I get the strong Etag '19e60b-20-279033c0'. Neither Apache nor somebody else changed the content, it is just what I sent in the PUT request. And this makes no sense to the client.  The reason is in modules/http/http_etag.c, ap_make_etag():       * If the request was made within a second of the last-modified date,      * we send a weak tag instead of a strong one, since it could      * be modified again later in the second, and the validation      * would be incorrect.  What should be the sense of this (would be nice if you could explain it to me)?  - changes may happen at any time. Why are young files bad and old ones good?  - are there race conditions within in Apache, so the Etag will not match the body of the response (mtime and etag are evaluated at one time, the response-body some time later)? In this case a weak Etag is just as wrong as strong one. Why should this race condition occur only within 1 second after the file has been modified? If this realy is the case, it needs debugging.  - when the Etag matches the body of the response, it is completely ok to change the content on the server 0.1 microsecond later (because this will change Etag).  As long as Apache (or some module) does not distinguish between 'semantically significant changes' and changing some byte, there is no reason for weak Etags (see RFC 2616, 13.3.3 Weak and Strong Validators).  For any caching WebDAV-client, it is essential to get the Etag of files uploaded to the server. If this is impossible, the client has to throw away the local copy and download it from the server again -- but only after waiting at least one second.  Real world: As long as one uses only standard WebDAV (RFC 4918) with Apache mod_dav (I don't know about extension like versioning), or any other WebDAV-server, removing the weakness indicator is no problem at all. davfs2 does it, and I never heard of any problem that might be related to this.  P.S.: Servers, that don't edit the body of a PUT, should send a strong Etag and Last-Modiefied in the PUT-response, allthough the WebDAV Working Group was not able to address this problem. It would avoid race conditions.  (In reply to comment #7) > > Why would a client remove the weakness indicator? > Because the weakness indicator sent by Apache is nonsense.  But that doesn't mean that people should apply hacks to their clients.  > When I send a PUT request and immediately thereafter send a HEAD request, I > always get a weak Etag from Apache, say W/'19e60b-20-279033c0'.

Why are young files bad and old ones good?  As long as the timestamp of the file equals the system time, it can't be used to compute a strong etag (because the file can change again in the same interval).

That's because nobody has tested with other WebDAV servers that may assign weak etags for other reasons than the one you see in Apache/moddav.  > P.S.: Servers, that don't edit the body of a PUT, should send a strong Etag and > Last-Modiefied in the PUT-response, allthough the WebDAV Working Group was not > able to address this problem. It would avoid race conditions.  Actually, servers should send the ETag always, no matter whether the body was changed (IMHO). See proposal in http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-reschke-http-etag-on-write-latest.html (follow ups with respect to this on the http-wg mailing list, please).   Looks like this is the wrong place for our discussion. So I created a new bug report. (#42987 Weak Etags in Apache are useless and violate RFC 2616, 13.3.3) Please have a look at the test cases for the 'perfect sense' of apache-style weak etags in a conditional GET.  This bug is not specific to WebDAV! If-None-Match is a pure HTTP construct and as such fixing this bug should not touch mod_dav.  I'll post a patch shortly. Created an attachment (id=21295) Clean fix  This patch comes from mod_dav_acl-0.1.2 and was written by Jari Urpalainen.  Please consider applying and closing this bug. RFC 2616 says '...or if '*' is given and any current entity exists for that resource, then the server MUST NOT perform the requested method.'  Therefore, this patch assumes that the absence of an etag implies the absence of the entity.

The main thing preventing this bug from being closed is an actual commit to the source code.  This bug  has been opened for almost 2 years (16593 has been open for over 4.5 years!) and has seen 3 or 4  proposed patches.  When a bug sees this many patches and no action, then there is a scaling problem somewhere in the  development process.  Adoption of the litmus webdav test suite would also be good to prevent regressions.  I spoke to Greg  Stein at ApacheCon last month about this bug and he mentioned that he had tested If-Match / If- None-Match behavior when he originally wrote mod_dav.  Unfortunately, mod_dav has regressed in  that regard.  An automated test would have caught the regression. (In reply to comment #14)  > I'm not qualified to provide advice on that question. But please note that the > patch can easily be modified if this assumption turns out not to be valid. So > the only thing preventing this bug from being closed is making this decision.  (Ok, my last reply was me venting.  Here is my more productive response ;-)  The patch may be easily modified to any particular state, but deciding on that state is the hard part ;-)   In this case, if the assumption is not valid (which I do not believe it is), then we must decide on how we  signify that a resource does not exist (i.e. is null).  The email thread I pointed you to discusses that  issue somewhat.  Chris Darroch proposed NON_EXTANT_RESOURCE or NO_RESOURCE.  Paritosh had  already submitted a patch with 'resource-exists' but then later agreed with Chris on using  NO_RESOURCE (a trivial change to the patch).   Then in the next month, after discussing this bug with  Paul Querna at ApacheCon, Paritosh attempted to revive the thread and proposed another possible  approach endorsed by Paul.  No one replied to Paritosh's email.  At that point, Paritosh and I decided not to invest more time in creating and testing yet another patch  which may not make it into Apache.   We're not opposed to doing so in the future, but we'd like to get  our own automated testing infrastructure setup specifically for our patches to Apache (there are more  to come).  Testing that mod_dav_fs still works by hand for every patch (and every time a patch needs to  be changed) is time consuming.    Right now, we are under increasing pressure to tend more to our non-open-source-community tasks  at our company.  We hope to devote more time to pushing fixes for bugs such as this one in the near  future.  Hopefully, your and our efforts will not be in vain.  btw, please vote for this bug if you haven't done so already.   The patch proposed by Simon Perreault only treats the bug in 'If-None-Match: *', but the same bug is in 'If-Match: *' and must be fixed too.  >> Is this an assumption we want to make? >I'm not qualified to provide advice on that question. But please note that the >patch can easily be modified if this assumption turns out not to be valid. So >the only thing preventing this bug from being closed is making this decision.  Evaluation of 'If-Match: *' and 'If-None-Match: *' depends on whether the resources does *exist*. I do not know, whether checking for the existence of an Etag is equivalent to checking for the existence of the resource. But if you want to do it this way, you must *know*. I am worrying about the idea of making a decision about making an *assumption*.  >This bug is not specific to WebDAV! If-None-Match is a pure HTTP construct and >as such fixing this bug should not touch mod_dav.  This is true, and it is wrong. Most applications seem not to use 'If-None-Match: *' and 'If-Match: *' and will therefore not be affected by this bug. But these conditionals are essential for WebDAV. So - it would be *nice* to have a clean and general solution - it is *necessary* to fix that bug for WebDAV.  As it is, a WebDAV-client can either work reliable or work with Apache. These two options are exclusive.  Cheers Werner  Additional remark an equivalence of 'check for existence' and 'check for Etag':  I am not familiar with apache programming, so this is based on one assumption. - Apache modules can register their own, specialised ap_make_etag-function, overriding apaches generic ap_make_etag-function.  If this assumption is true, it would be perfectly reasonable for a module, to return an etag only if the resource is cacheable, and to return NULL if the resource is not cacheable. So checking for the existance of an etag can not replace the check for existance of the resource.  I think a clean, general solution should be in the line of the patch provided by Paritosh Shah. There must also be a clean solution for the potential problems considerd by Paritosh Shah and Chris Darroch.  As I understand, a clean solution might possibly change some internal interface and possibly affect other modules. I fully understand that this needs serious consideration and might take some time.  If it is therefore not possible to fix this bug in a clean, general way for the next release, I suggest that the next release should fix the bug for mod_dav only (so it will not affect other modules). You might use that ugly, code dublicating monster from me. As soon as a better solution is found, this mod_dav-only patch can be removed without side effects.  Werner  Created an attachment (id=21343) Fix against 2.2.x  Werner, can you please confirm that the attached patch against 2.2.x solves your problem? This is the version of the patch that should be backported. Referring to comment #20: I applied the patch to the Debian/Etch-version of Apache 2.2.3 and only exchanged mod_dav.so in the installed binary version.  All my tests succeeded (no errors).  The tests included (with response code):  LOCK If-None-Match: *, file does not exist 200 OK  PUT If-None-Match: *, file does not exist 201 Created  PUT If-None-Match: *, file does exist 412 Precondition Failed  PUT If-Match: *, file does exist 204 No Content  PUT If-Match: 'af508-2c-69e15c40', etag matches existing file 204 No Content  PUT If-Match: 'quatsch', etag seems to not exactly match existing file 412 Precondition Failed  Thanks Werner  Just to be crystal clear: Everything is now as you expect, right? Yes!  Your patch fixes bug 38034.  Werner  Thanks for confirmation. I am sorry to say that it is likely that the patch missed the boat for 2.2.7, but it is highly likely that it will be part of 2.2.8 as it already has two votes for backport and only misses one:  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=609024 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/STATUS?view=markup&pathrev=609024  But at least a accepted patch that is already in trunk is now available. Thanks for being persistent. Just a question related to this issue - not sure if I'm 100% correct in my thinking yet...  Did ap_meet_condition fail because the ETag for the non-existant file is constantly changing (mtime only ETag from http_etag.c) as there is no finfo (as a by product of it not existing)?  locks on non-existent files create a .DAV/.locknull so a resource does actually exist (a lock-null resource)? is this correct?  I'm happy with the present work-around but if what i'm thinking is the case then a cleaner fix in the future could be having mod_dav always providing its ETags (overriding http_etag for DAV directories) and as it knows about lock-null resources it could use the .locknull file for a constant inode-size-mtime Etag instead of just mtime, making ap_meets_condition happy?  That's if my assumptions are correct. In reply to comment #25:  Lock-null resources do *not* exist. Only the name is locked to prevent other clients from creating a resource with that name.  Lock-null resources have no etag and no mtime associated.  GET requests on lock-null resources will fail with 404 NOT FOUND.  An LOCK If-None-Match: * must fail with '423 LOCKED' (not 412 PRECONDITION FAILED).  Finally: Locked-null resources are deprecated by RFC 4918 in favour of locked-empty resources, which do exist. They will probably disappear in an overhaul of mod_dav.  Etags in mod_dav and mod_dav_fs should be handled separately from the Apache core. This is an open issue which cannot be solved that easy. Please see Bug report #42987 as well as the discussion thread starting at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200710.mbox/%3c470E9A9F.8020202@pearsoncmg.com%3e  Werner  Sorry, it's me again.  There seems to be a related bug in the way apache/mod_dav handles conditional PUT with header If-Unmodified-Since. It will always fail because ap_meets_conditions does not know the mtime of the resource. This bug will not show up most of the time as etag is checked first. I only noticed it, because a bug in davfs2 caused a PUT-request without If-Match-header and with If-Unmodified-Since-header.  As the interface documentation of ap_meets_conditions in include/http_protocal.h says, ap_meets_conditions is only ment for GET requests. It can't work with PUT. So a future revision should either change ap_meets_conditions, as proposed by Paritosh, or mod_dav should handle conditionals all of it's own (taking into account that the requirements of WebDAV are quite different in this respect).  Werner  > So a future revision should either change ap_meets_conditions, as proposed by > Paritosh, or mod_dav should handle conditionals all of it's own (taking into > account that the requirements of WebDAV are quite different in this respect).  The requirements fot WebDAV are exactly the same as for plain HTTP, except for the addition of the 'If' header.  Or am I missing something?  In reply to comment #28:  Yes, you missed the point.  Apache core does not handle PUT-requests and ap_meets_conditions is designed for GET/HEAD-requests only (this is documented behaviour). This is perfectly OK for the vast majority of Web-servers (they don't need and don't want PUT). WebDAV is about authoring and PUT is essential.  Why ap_meets_conditions cannot work with PUT: ap_meets_conditions compares the validators from the request with the validators from the response. This is OK for GET. With PUT-requests, the validators from the request have to be compared to the validators associated with the stored entity before the PUT-body is stored. The validators in the response will be different.  It is up to the decision by Apache developers, whether they want to - change ap_meets_conditions (this will change the interface), or - leave it to modules like mod_dav to check the conditions according to their needs.  Werner  What you're describing are the differences between Apache httpd and moddav, not between RFC2616 and RFC4918.  PUT is part of RFC2616, so are all conditional headers (except 'If'). Maybe an HTTP server implementation that does not support PUT can get away with a simpler *implementation*, but that doesn't really change the required semantics.  Hello Julian,  the header ot this page says 'ASF Bugzilla'. I assume 'A' stands for Apache, not for Anything.  Werner  (In reply to comment #29) > the vast majority of Web-servers (they don't need and don't want PUT). WebDAV is  If Apache just wants to keep the status quo, then yes.

I can confirm that your CGI script with an If-Modified-Since header later than the Last-Modified date supplied by the script does indeed return 200 with no body.  That's broken, but is it Apache or the script that's at fault[1]?  RFC2616 says of If-Modified-Since:       c) If the variant has not been modified since a valid If-^M         Modified-Since date, the server SHOULD return a 304 (Not^M         Modified) response.^M  That makes sense: the script is stupid but technically within its rights to send the 200 unconditionally.  So Apache should presumably accommodate it by ignoring the If-Modified-Since header and returning 200 with the full body.  If that's not already in bugzilla, you might consider entering it there.  [1] It's both, of course.  -- Nick Kew Fixed in trunk:  r370692  Are you sure you don't want to convert a CGI-generated 200 to a 304 when the HTTP conditions fail?  ap_scan_script_header_err is also called by mod_asis .  I use mod_asis extensively, with files which include Last-Modified: and ETag: headers, and it would be disastrous to return 200 when 304 would be appropriate.  Admittedly, I've had to patch both mod_asis.c and util_script.c to get the right results, but my server seems to return the responses I expect. (In reply to comment #3)  > Are you sure you don't want to convert a CGI-generated 200 to a 304 when the  > HTTP conditions fail?    There are two cases.  If the CGI *explicitly* generates a Status: header, we  should honour it.  If not, then we just need to generate whatever is  appropriate - usually 200, or 302 if the CGI emitted a Location header.    >   ap_scan_script_header_err is also called by mod_asis .  I    The crucial difference thare is that mod_asis isn't documented as having a  Status header (though I guess it might, if it goes through the same parsing as  CGI).    > use mod_asis extensively, with files which include Last-Modified: and ETag:  > headers, and it would be disastrous to return 200 when 304 would be  appropriate.    Your asis doesn't say 'Status: foo'?

With Nick's fix, apache with sample cgi return 200,200,200,200. Both cases, no more white (empty) display. But,which one is better solution?  The CGI spec. is quite explicit on this:    7.2.1.3. Status     The 'Status' header field is used to indicate to the server what status code   the server MUST use in the response message.    so a patch that causes it to change that breaks CGI.    Having said that, for the particular example reported in this bug, Joe's fix  is better in practical terms.  That's because the CGI script itself misused  'status'.  See todays thread on dev@httpd.  Notwithstanding a semantically flawed sentence in a draft which expired over six years ago, a CGI script which includes cache validation headers in its response cannot rely on a status code of 200 being returned to the client.  An HTTP/1.1 proxy may return a 304 response without troubling the server; or if it has to transmit the request via an HTTP/1.0 proxy it may convert a conditional GET to a HEAD whose 200 response may be converted to a 304 if the conditions are satisfied.  Insisting that a 200 response with cache validation headers be transmitted unchanged is futile.  The draft supposedly encodes current CGI practice, but I suspect that in the area of cache validation headers in CGI-generated responses there is no current practice to encode.  The documentation for mod_asis says 'A Status: header is also required', where 'required' implies that it can never be omitted.  Since the header handling is common with mod_cgi the documentation is plainly wrong.  I have removed the Status line from my 802 .asis files with no ill effects.  Whatever the outcome of the argument about 'Status: 200' with a 'Last-Modified:' which satisfies a conditional request, I'm going to have to continue to patch ap_scan_script_header_err to include my 'ETag:' headers in the check. (In response to Dave Sparks)    1. What a proxy can do with a response is totally independent of CGI rules.   They operate at different levels, and affect different agents.    2. Thanks for the headsup re: mod_asis documentation.  I've just fixed  the .xml source, so that should propagate through to the live docs in due  course.    3. You keep telling us you had to patch a problem, but I still can't see a  problem description.

The output of the cat command of the libphp5.la in the /usr/local/apache/modules/libphp5.la result in ..  --snip-- # libphp5.la - a libtool library file # Generated by ltmain.sh - GNU libtool 1.5.18 (1.1220.2.245 2005/05/16 08:55:27) # # Please DO NOT delete this file! # It is necessary for linking the library.  # The name that we can dlopen(3). dlname='libphp5.so'  # Names of this library. library_names='libphp5.a libphp5.a'  # The name of the static archive. old_library=''  # Libraries that this one depends upon. dependency_libs=' -lssl -lcrypto -lssl -lcrypto -lssl -lcrypto -L/usr/local/ssl/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lssl -lcrypto -lssl -lcrypto -lm /usr/local/lib/libcurl.la -lssl -lcrypto -lssl -lcrypto /usr/local/lib/libodbc.la -ldl -liconv -lthread'  # Version information for libphp5. current=0 age=0 revision=0  # Is this an already installed library? installed=yes  # Should we warn about portability when linking against -modules? shouldnotlink=yes  # Files to dlopen/dlpreopen dlopen='' dlpreopen=''  # Directory that this library needs to be installed in: libdir='/usr/local/src/php-5.1.1/libs' --snip--  if that can be of a further help here.. Can you try adding at the top of build/instdso.sh:  LANG=C LC_ALL=C LANGUAGE=C export LANG LC_ALL LANGUAGE  (and then 'make install' from httpd, then try installing PHP again) Still get the same error but it look a little better...

Assuming installing a .so rather than a libtool archive. --snip--  Noticed that the '0602-404' is no longer there in the new error message.  I'm not sure if the AIX's native sed is that compatible with that sed script or not. Created an attachment (id=17816) Patch file to avoid sed errors on installing apache 2.2  I believe the patch file I attached will eliminate sed error. It has been affected to all environments so that the ${prefix}/modules  directory contains '.a' and '.la' files because of this error. >LANG=C >LC_ALL=C >LANGUAGE=C >export LANG LC_ALL LANGUAGE  The sed error you were referring to, I found out it only apply to AIX 4.3, not AIX 5.2.  Trying your patch that eliminate the sed error and it seem to work pretty well with no sed error but I get further compile error.  Here's what I got...  --snip-- Installing PHP SAPI module:       apache2handler /usr/local/apache2/build/instdso.sh SH_LIBTOOL='/usr/local/apache2/build/libtool' libphp5.la /usr/local/apache2/modules rm -f /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.so /usr/local/apache2/build/libtool --mode=install cp libphp5.la /usr/local/apache2/modules/ cp .libs/libphp5.a /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.a cp .libs/libphp5.lai /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.la libtool: install: warning: remember to run "libtool --finish /usr/local/src/php-5.1.2/libs' chmod 755 /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.so chmod: /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.so: A file or directory in the path name does not exist. apxs:Error: Command failed with rc=65536 --snip--  So, I check the /usr/local/apache2/module directory and found there is no libphp5.so file.  So, with further studying and tracing to the instdso.sh script I noticed that   --snip-- rm -f /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.so --snip--   is removed first as to remove the older or obselote file.  Then the next part get executed..  --snip-- /usr/local/apache2/build/libtool --mode=install cp libphp5.la /usr/local/apache2/modules/ --snip--  which does in fact copy both files, libphp5.a and libphp5.la files, not the libphp5.so file.  So, hte next few part of the script which use sed.  With some tracing and execution of a shell script.  I get  --snip-- libphp5.so   libphp5.a libphp5.a   libphp5.a libphp5.a --snip--  and no sed error.  So, we the patch is working as it fix this bug.  Then further below in the script is a 'rm -f ....' script that remove those libphp5.a files so it explained why there's no libphp5.* files in that directory.  Which lead us to the next part of the script that caused the   --snip-- Warning!  dlname not found in /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.la. --snip--  to appear.  Then the next part of the script here  --snip-- if test '$DLNAME' != '$TARGET_NAME' then     mv $TARGETDIR/$DLNAME $TARGETDIR/$TARGET_NAME fi --snip--  where the 'if test' script produced a result..  --snip-- if test 'libphp5.so' != 'libphp5.so' then      mv /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp5.so /usr/local/apache2/modules/ fi --snip--  So, this part of the script is correct and there's still no libphp5.so in that directory at all.  The next part of the script just removed everything.  So, no wonder why I get the apxs errors and chmod error.  The libphp5.so is never copied over in the first place.  I'm looking forward to a further patch fix that would allow the libphp5.so to be put into the /usr/local/apache2/module directory...  It is just a bad script.  So, go ahead and check in that patch fix as it fix this AIX sed problem.... Nice work Masaoki, was that patch to fix the issue with the AIX sed too?  We've had a report of a similar error on Solaris too (bug 38696) so I've asked whether this fix works there too. this time, adding CC:  Nice work Masaoki, was that patch to fix the issue with the AIX sed too?  We've had a report of a similar error on Solaris too (bug 38696) so I've asked whether this fix works there too. > was that patch to fix the issue with the AIX sed too? Yea, for the AIX sed? Actually I don't have AIX environment.  This was not the right place to post the patch.  However, I guess, this should be common problem as just sed script string was wrong.  I confirmed my pacth works on RedHat 7.3 x86 and Solaris 10 x86. *** Bug 38696 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I meant to say this patch fix for AIX's sed now work without a problem.  So,  it's a good thing you posted here.  Since you mentioned Red Hat too.  (Along  with Sun)  OS --> All  Let us know the patch had been check into the branch.  The newer problem I have is not a sed bug (with the patch fix) so I'll file a  new bug later (cleaner bug report) on this week or next week as soon as I  finish rebuilting AIX from scratch.  (Well PHP folks said I need GNU Linker  which doesn't solve the problem.  Also later learned that GNU Linker doesn't  work too well with AIX as it's incompactible with AIX and IBM's web site said  we only need to use the AIX's native sed instead of the GNU linker.  A sign of  further messed up.) The original sed script works fine on GNU sed 4.1.2, while it does not on GNU  sed 3.1 or Solaris sed. The patched script works fine on all of above. Filed bug #39099 for the php module that doesn't work in Apache 2.2.0.  Any chance of anyone testing this patch any further or checking it in to the branch without breaking it before the next Apache release?  I thought I did see somewhere in the Apache file that specify the minimum GNU Sed version somewhere but I couldn't find it.  Is the reason for this bug being unchanged due to not assigning the bug to bugs@httpd.apache.org instead of leaving it as new?  This bugzilla is a little confusing as I'm so used to the Mozilla's bugzilla.  Sorry for the spam if I misunderstood. No, just lazy engineers lacking round tuits.  This is now committed to the trunk, and proposed for inclusion in 2.2.x.  http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=389797&view=rev  Thanks again for the patch, Masaoki.

As of now I have tested it with version 2.0.54-r31 of Gentoo with the hardened USE flag turned on and on OpenBSD 3.8 (don't remember the version here though).	This is because httpd is waiting for more header data. Please lower the value of TimeOut (default 300 seconds) to mitigate this problem. In general this can happen with lots of other incompletely sent header situations. Not a security bug because the request does timeout.  But not a proper response to the request either.  httpd should give an immediate error rather than waiting.

38227	null	RESOLVED		Brad Boyer	1137012240000	1145719595000		AJP proxy not thread-safe? I had to change from using worker MPM to prefork to avoid connection loss with the AJP proxy code. I'm using httpd 2.2.0 and tomcat 5.5.12. I get these errors in the apache httpd error log:  [Wed Jan 11 11:20:33 2006] [error] (70007)The timeout specified has expired: ajp_ilink_receive() can't receive header [Wed Jan 11 11:20:33 2006] [error] ajp_read_header: ajp_ilink_receive failed [Wed Jan 11 11:20:33 2006] [error] (120006)APR does not understand this error code: proxy: read response failed from (null) (127.0.0.1)  These 3 lines repeat numerous times, and it does not seem to reconnect to tomcat until reloaded. Changing to prefork appears to eliminate these errors.  This situation occurs after less than an hour of load testing, and is fairly consistent. With the MPM changed over to prefork, the error has not been seen over much longer test periods under the same load.  The configuration is an apache httpd doing a ProxyPass to a tomcat running on the same box. If it matters, the httpd is also using mod_ssl and these requests are coming in over https.  This is a locally compiled build of 2.2.0, with the only changed code being the patch that can be found in bug 29744.	In order to make it reconnect please add retry=1 to your ProxyPass directive (see also parameter retry at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypass) Have you checked for the Tomcat logs? The first error seems to indicate that Tomcat is not responding any longer  I have experienced the same bug, the problem also seem to cause the tomcat server (5.0.28) to run out of threads, I assume the problem is also causing the ajp threads not to be closed, so I assume using a retry will not help. Yet to confirm whether using prefork instead of worker fixes the problem, but I'll try this and add this to the bug report.  ajp_read_header: ajp_ilink_receive failed (120006)APR does not understand this error code: proxy: read response failed from (null) (<ip_addr_here>) Then later  proxy: AJP: failed to make connection to backend: <ip_addr_here> (110)Connection timed out: proxy: AJP: attempt to connect to <ip_addr_here>:8009 (<ip_addr_here>) failed  It looks like tomcat can recover if it is under light load and the threads timeout, but when the load increases tomcat dies as all the threads get used up   Maybe PR#36495 is a similar bug. Could you please provide your proxy config? The config in bug 36495 is very similar to my original situation. Apache httpd 2.2 and tomcat runnnig together on a single Linux box with the config on httpd using ProxyPass to redirect to 127.0.0.1:8009. The messages once the poster moved to 2.2 are basically the same.  Here's the proxy config I have (with some URL segments changed to xxx):      ProxyRequests off     <Proxy *>         Order allow,deny         Deny from all     </Proxy>     <Proxy ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/*>         Order deny,allow         Allow from all     </Proxy>     ProxyPass /xxx ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/xxx After further testing this appears to be a problem with a misconfigured tomcat, the ajp connector behaves differently in worker mode than prefork and requires a larger number of tomcat ajp threads. Tested this under extreemly heavy load and all seems to work ok with no problems. This is all documented in the connector docs, I guess I should have picked this up earlier. Thanks for feedback. Could you please add the link to the connector docs where you found the information that solved your problem? Fixing the tomcat configuration did help, but it still appears that we are having the same problem where tomcat will run out of threads using ajp mod_proxy in worker mode. We cannot reproduce this problem in testing, only on the live systems. No real errors from apache except this, by which point tomcat has run out of threads, which I assume why this error appears. [error] (70007)The timeout specified has expired: ajp_ilink_receive() can't receive header  We also get this error in prefork mode, but it does not seem to cause tomcat to die I'm seeing similar errors.

It computes a random number been 0 and 1000, and sleeps for that many milliseconds, before printing a one line response to the client.   THE PROBLEM  Using this stripped down configuration, what I see when I use ab(1) to load test the service, is that Tomcat is forced to keep creating new threads to service incoming connections, and it leaves them in the Keepalive state after ab(1) has finished.  Tomcat also indicates it is *using* those threads (perhaps polling on them?)  Every time I make a new request via mod_proxy, a new Thread is started in Tomcat.  However, when I query Tomcat directly, I see a thread get created, the request gets serviced, and the thread is switch to the Ready steady, indicating it is now able to to accept new requests.  If I run    netstat -t | egrep '^tcp.*:8009'  on the server, I see a constantly growing number of connections between Apache and Tomcat.  When I query Tomcat directly, I do not see this growing pool of connections.  This lead me to believe the problem was mod_proxy keeping connections open (perhaps the backend pooling code), but failing to either reuse them, or perhaps failing to properly close them on cleanup.   THE DEBUGGING   First, I added some debugging to proxy_util.c.\tI've attached it to this comment.  Basically all I did was print out a stupid log message when it first initializes, and then each time a connections is acquired.  Now, starting up Apache I see this in the log:  [Wed Apr 05 21:09:35 2006] [error] 0: worker->hmax: 25, worker->cp->res: not null [Wed Apr 05 21:09:35 2006] [debug] proxy_util.c(1666): proxy: initialized worker 0 in child 16610 for (server.mydomain.org) min=0 max=25 smax=25 [Wed Apr 05 21:09:35 2006] [error] 0: worker->hmax: 25, worker->cp->res: not null [Wed Apr 05 21:09:35 2006] [debug] proxy_util.c(1666): proxy: initialized worker 2 in child 16610 for (*) min=0 max=25 smax=25  For my test I first see if any connections exist to Tomcat (there should not be any):   ; netstat -t | egrep '^tcp.*:8009' | tr -s ' '  As I expect, no connections exist.  Next, on a different machine, I make a single request to my virtual host:    ab -n 1  http://vhost.mydomain.org/test  It completes, and tells me it was successful.  I see a bunch of debugging in the log indicating mod_proxy is working.  In the chatter, I see my own debugging lines:  [Wed Apr 05 21:09:43 2006] [error] 1: worker->hmax: 0, worker->cp->res: not null [Wed Apr 05 21:09:43 2006] [error] 2: called connection_constructor  This surprises me for two reasons.  First of all, I was expecting worker->hmax to be 25, not 0.  The second reason is that I expected to see that worker->cp->res have a value, not to be null.  [As an aside, subsequent testing showed that if I added 'max=25' to the BalanceMember configuration directive, worker->hmax would be 25 in requests; the null value for worker->cp->res did not change.]  Now, I check on my server to see if any connections exist (I expect a connection, due to the connection pooling):  ; netstat -t | egrep '^tcp.*:8009' | tr -s ' ' tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:8009 server.mydomain.org:39642 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:39642 server.mydomain.org:8009 ESTABLISHED   Now, if I run a second request, I would have expected mod_proxy_ajp to reuse the existing connection.\tBut look what happens after I ran my ab command a second time:  [Wed Apr 05 21:09:46 2006] [error] 1: worker->hmax: 0, worker->cp->res: null [Wed Apr 05 21:09:46 2006] [error] 2: called connection_constructor  And netstat shows two *new* connections, for a total of four:    ; netstat -t | egrep '^tcp.*:8009' | tr -s ' '   tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:8009 server.mydomain.org:39753 ESTABLISHED   tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:8009 server.mydomain.org:39642 ESTABLISHED   tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:39753 server.mydomain.org:8009 ESTABLISHED   tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:39642 server.mydomain.org:8009 ESTABLISHED  I tried making a number of connections, and watched the connections grow until it filled all available threads on my Tomcat container (which was set to the default maxThreads of 200).  First, I reset everything:    ; apachectl stop   ; catalina.sh stop    ; apachectl start   ; catalina.sh start    ; netstat -t | egrep '^tcp.*:8009' | tr -s ' '|wc -l \t0  And then on my test client I make 200 connections:     ab -n 200 http://vhost.mydomain.org/test  and then my server shows over 400 established connections:    ; netstat -t | egrep '^tcp.*:8009' | tr -s ' '|grep -c ESTABLISHED   466  Ack!  If I tweak the proxy code, setting one of these the 'close' flags to true:    conn->close_on_recycle = 1;   conn->close = 1;  Then Apache cleans itself up, and Tomcat does not get overwhelmed.  What I'm unable to determine so far is if this is a problem with mod_proxy(_(balance|ajp))?.c, a problem with Tomcat + Apache, a problem with the APR utilities, etc.  :(  Any insights from folks would be much appreciated!  Apologies for the long post...   Jim  Thank you very much for your detailed post. I suspect a thing that has been fixed meanwhile. Could you please give http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/httpd-2.2.1.tar.gz a try? Keep in mind that this is NO official release of httpd-2.2.1, but one that the developers are currently deciding on whether to release it or not. It is known that this tarball currently contains a bug that prevents using SSL backends with the proxy, but this does not harm your current problem. It would be very nice if you could give it a try and let me know the results.  Another thing regarding your astonishments regarding the reusing of connections. Keep in mind that the pool limit is PER httpd process. So the maximum number of connections is not what you set via max, but <max> * <maximum number of httpd processes>. You have not posted your MPM settings here, so if you allow httpd to create 8 processes, 200 connections to the backend are ok.  > And netstat shows two *new* connections, for a total of four: >  >  ; netstat -t | egrep '^tcp.*:8009' | tr -s ' ' >  tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:8009 server.mydomain.org:39753 ESTABLISHED >  tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:8009 server.mydomain.org:39642 ESTABLISHED >  tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:39753 server.mydomain.org:8009 ESTABLISHED >  tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:39642 server.mydomain.org:8009 ESTABLISHED  Actually there is only *one* more connection, but as httpd and Tomcat are running on the same server you see *both* ends of the tcp connection in netstat. If you are running httpd and tomcat on the same server you have to divide your netstat results by 2. (In reply to comment #10) > Thank you very much for your detailed post.

I was about to post that I had added some more debugging and discovered that mod_proxy was emitting info that it had initialized worker->id 0 and worked->id 2, but not worker->id 1, and that mod_proxy_ajp was being handed worker->id 1. Dunno if that was the problem being resolved in the fix.   I will try 2.2.1 right now.  It'll take me a few minutes to compile and test, but I'll post back here within the hour.  > Actually there is only *one* more connection, but as httpd and Tomcat are > running on the same server you see *both* ends of the tcp connection in  Sorry, reading my original post shows I put too much stress on the high number of connections.  I was in fact realizing the two lines were from the same connection, I was just surprised that new sockets kept getting added instead of old ones being reused.

I slowly increased the concurrent requests (from the original *1* thread I was using in the tests I originally posted about), to tens of threads, without seeing an undue increase in the number of used connections.  I note that Tomcat does still eventually reach 200 active threads when I hit it Apache with many requests, but it appears as though Apache is now reusing existing connections.  From this first pass, it looks to me like 2.2.1 fixes the problem I was having. Thank you very much for your help!

Hi,  I've done some more testing, and I *think* I may have found a bug with the load balancer.  I am running httpd 2.2.1, with server/thread limits of    StartServers 8   ServerLimit 16   ThreadsPerChild 64  I allowed for 1024 threads on the Tomcat side.\tThe proxy setup is the same as I mention in comment #9.  When I was initially load testing the 2.2.1 server, I happened to be setting the max attributes on the balancer:    <Proxy balancer://tomcat>     BalancerMember ajp://server.mydomain.org:8009 route=server.mydomain.org max=64   </Proxy>  This seemed rock solid, I threw batches of 500+ concurrent requests from our Sun Fire T2000 to this linux server, and it dealt with the load.  However, I then tried removing the 'max' attribute, and ran into some problem.  I found that, without the hard-coded the max attribute, I could reliably lock the system up when throwing 500 concurrent requests at it.  My understanding from previous comments and the notes is that, if one does not specify additional attributes, the defaults should be to use the ThreadsPerChild to set s/max:    smin=0  smax=64 max=64  Setting LogLevel to debug I saw that mod_proxy code says  [debug] proxy_util.c(1690): proxy: initialized worker 0 in child 15926 for (argo02.highwire.org) min=0 max=64 smax=64 [debug] proxy_util.c(1690): proxy: initialized worker 2 in child 15926 for (*) min=0 max=64 smax=64  But that it never said it had initialized worker 1.  Adding my own debugging, I can see that 'worker 1' is the one which is being used by the balancer, and that the 'worker 1' hmax was always 0 *if I did not set the 'max=64' attribute.*  In other words, it was never inheriting the 'default' hmax.  Delving into the mod_balancer code, I found that    mod_proxy_balancer.c:77   init_balancer_member(proxy_server_conf *, server_rec *, proxy_balancer *)  was running    ap_proxy_initialize_worker_share(conf, workers, s);  but was not running, as far as I could tell, anything which might initialize all the other fields for the worker.  Is this a bug?  I noted that mod_proxy.c:1867 and mod_proxy.c:1868 performs a two-step initialization, where it calls ap_proxy_initialize_worker_share and then it calls   ap_proxy_initialize_worker(workers, s);  Now, I don't know if this lack of a two-step initialization in mod_proxy_balancer is a problem (or if it just a lack of understanding of the code on my part), but I am finding that adding the second initialization call to init_balancer_member seemed to fix the problem for me (the default, ThreadsPerChild based, hmax was picked up for worker 1).  Any thoughts?  Thank you for your time,  Jim  Folks,  I don't know if my previous followup on this bug was read or not, or if people are already looking at it.  Without feedback, I can't tell if I should keep pursuing this, follow up with more details, etc.  I can understand somebody telling me 'No, we know this isn't the problem' but I'm not hearing anything.  Without feedback I'm stuck not knowing if this is a bug or a fatal misunderstanding on my part.  Given httpd 2.2.1 and the following settings:    Server Version: Apache/2.2.1 (Unix) DAV/2 mod_ssl/2.2.1 OpenSSL/0.9.7a   Server Built: Apr 6 2006 00:22:26   Module Magic Number: 20051115:1   Hostname/port: server.mydomain.org:80   Timeouts: connection: 300    keep-alive: 300   MPM Name: Worker   MPM Information: Max Daemons: 2 Threaded: yes Forked: yes   Server Architecture: 32-bit   Server Root: /highwire/server/apache   Config File: -c/-C directives   Server Built With:     -D APACHE_MPM_DIR='server/mpm/worker'     -D APR_HAS_SENDFILE     -D APR_HAS_MMAP     -D APR_HAVE_IPV6 (IPv4-mapped addresses enabled)     -D APR_USE_SYSVSEM_SERIALIZE     -D SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT     -D APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD     -D AP_HAVE_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS     -D HTTPD_ROOT='/usr/local/apache/2.2.1'     -D SUEXEC_BIN='/usr/local/apache/2.2.1/bin/suexec'     -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG='logs/error_log'     -D AP_TYPES_CONFIG_FILE='conf/mime.types'     -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE='conf/httpd.conf'  It appears as though the mod_proxy pool of connections is not being consistently reused when the balancer is used.  Given the configuration:    ServerLimit 2   ThreadsPerChild 10    <Proxy balancer://tomcat>     BalancerMember ajp://server.mydomain.org:8009 route=server.mydomain.org   </Proxy>    <VirtualHost  vhost.mydomain.org:80>     ServerName  vhost.mydomain.org      RewriteEngine on      RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPD_BASE}/logs/myapp.pause -f     RewriteRule .* - [forbidden,last]      DocumentRoot vhosts/myapp/htdocs      RewriteRule ^(/+test(?:/.*)?)$ /myapp$1 [env=internal:yes]      RewriteCond %{ENV:internal} =yes     RewriteRule ^(/+myapp/.*)  $1 [passthrough,last]     RewriteRule ^/+myapp/(.*) /$1 [redirect=permanent,last]      ProxyPass /myapp balancer://tomcat/myapp stickysession=JSESSIONID nofailover=on     ProxyPassReverse / http://vhost.mydomain.org/myapp/     ProxyPassReverseCookiePath /myapp/ /   </VirtualHost>  My understanding of the documentation    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypass  is that, with the above ServerLimit and ThreadPerChild limit, we should never see more than 20 connections form between Apache and any one BalancerMember target (2 servers x 10 threads = 20 total threads).  On startup, we see zero connections between Apache and Tomcat:    ; netstat -t | tr -s ' ' | egrep '^tcp.*:8009 ESTABLISHED'   ;  I make one request, and see one connection form:    ; ab -n 1 http://vhost.mydomain.org/test   ; netstat -t | tr -s ' ' | egrep '^tcp.*:8009 ESTABLISHED'   tcp 0 0 server.mydomain.org:59165 server.mydomain.org:8009 ESTABLISHED  Now what happens if I make 20 concurrent requests? What I would expect to see is up to 20 connections established, and no more.    ; ab -c 20 -n 20 http://vhost.mydomain.org/test   ; netstat -t | tr -s ' ' | egrep '^tcp.*:8009 ESTABLISHED'|wc -l        21  If I make another 20 connections, I see the connections more than double:    ; ab -c 20 -n 20 http://vhost.mydomain.org/test   ; netstat -t | tr -s ' ' | egrep '^tcp.*:8009 ESTABLISHED'|wc -l        44  Now look what happens when I plug in min/smax/max settings into the BalancerMember directive.  These are settings which I think the documentation indicates are the defaults, given my configuration above:    <Proxy balancer://tomcat>     BalancerMember ajp://server.mydomain.org:8009 route=server.mydomain.org min=0 smax=10 max=10   </Proxy>  After an apache restart, we have no connections, I make a bunch of requests, and see 20 connections, and never more than that.  Even when I make 50 concurrent requests, Apache simply queues and processes as it should:    ; netstat -t | tr -s ' ' | egrep '^tcp.*:8009 ESTABLISHED'|wc -l         0    ; ab -c 20 -n 20 http://vhost.mydomain.org/test   ; netstat -t | tr -s ' ' | egrep '^tcp.*:8009 ESTABLISHED'|wc -l        20    ; ab -c 50 -n 50 http://vhost.mydomain.org/test   ; netstat -t | tr -s ' ' | egrep '^tcp.*:8009 ESTABLISHED'|wc -l        20  If we activate the balancer, and the balancer has only one Tomcat target as in this case, shouldn't it should still be obeying the same limits as defined in the configuration.  Otherwise we have a situation where the number of proxy connections is unbounded, right?  Say Apache is configured to serve no more than 1024 requests at any one moment in time, and we wanted to balance load between two Tomcat servers.  What we'd probably do is set up two Tomcat servers which are each configured to accept 1024 requests, but we would expect to see apache balancer send ~512 requests to each Tomcat server.  What we would *not* expect to see is Apache opening more connections to a Tomcat server than Apache itself is configured to serve at any one time.  In summary, it appears to be a bug to have to declare min/smax/max values which are the same as the defaults per the documentation, without which the number of connections opened appears to be unbounded.  My examination of the code led me to believe that the source of the problem is that the BalancerMember worker is not getting its hmax value properly initialized, and that it is therefore bypassing the pool of reusable connections when it is acquiring connections (proxy_util.c:1758, in ap_proxy_acquire_connection).  If I add the patch I submitted in comment #14 and remove the min/smax/max directives, I see the behavior I am expecting -- Apache never opens more than 20 connections in all to its Tomcat server.  Looking at svn.apache.org, I see that initialization was actually removed in a previous version, though the comments do not explain why it is not appropriate to initialize the balancer worker:    http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/proxy/proxy_balancer.c?rev=105347&r1=105320&r2=105347  The only reason I can think of to have the current behavior is that somehow the dynamic of balancing between multiple backend servers is expected to be able to handle more connections -- but it just doesn't make sense to me that it would ever be normal for Apache to open more connections to any one backend server than Apache can serve itself.  If this isn't considered a bug, I'd very much appreciate it if someone would point out the reason.  Thank you for your time,   Jim  You are correct this is a bug. I checked your patch and it looks fine. I have not committed it yet, because I want to find out the reason, why we are making a copy of each worker we add to a balancer (see http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200604.mbox/%3c443F81D8.3030401@apache.org%3e). If we would not make a copy of each worker there would be no need for additional initialization. Thank you for the details. My impression has been that the additional worker copies are somehow meant to be virtual, and the intent was to have them resolve to the actual workers.  I wasn't actually seeing where that occured in the code though.  I'll watch the email thread you refer to with interest! Please let me know if you need any further debugging/testing done.  If it turns out that copying the worker is not really the correct thing to do it would require several changes to the code to do this differently. These changes will take some time. As your patch does not run in a wrong direction and we actually have the bug now I committed your patch to the trunk as r394446 (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=394446&view=rev). Proposed for backport to 2.2.x as r394653 (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=394653&view=rev).

Please consider adding the following OpenDocument mime types to the default apache configuration. The OpenDocument format is the OASIS standard for writing documents, and is supported by a number of applications including OpenOffice.org, KOffice, Abiword, and many more are developing support (e.g., Apache Lenya).      http://opendocumentfellowship.org/Resources/ForWebmasters  I attach a patch to add these types.  The mime types are in the process of being formally registered:    http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/office/200505/msg00002.html  This is related to bug #37185, I think that bug should possibly depend on this one. Also, would it be worth entering an equivalent bug against apache 1.3?	Created an attachment (id=17443) Proposed patch to add the necessary mime types.

From the first glance it seems to do the correct thing. Could you please attach a testcase (e.g. a jsp) such that I can doublecheck the patch? Forget about the example. I was not able to reproduce the problem, because I used Tomcat 5 to test which does not sent the headers back as integers any longer but as strings. BTW: Your trunk version of the patch is wrong as we need to peek at this position of the code. Nevertheless the 2.2.x version looks good and I will take care of it. Committed to trunk as r371013  (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=371013&view=rev) and proposed for  backport as r371014 (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=&view=rev).

Thank you, Ruediger!    I have a small comment on reproducing the problem.  default connector in Tomcat 4.1 is org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector  which works ok.  To reproduce the problem you have to use  org.apache.ajp.tomcat4.Ajp13Connector.  This is a part of server.xml as of jakarta-tomcat-4.1.31-src.tar.gz:        <!-- Define a Coyote/JK2 AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->      <Connector className='org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector'                 port='8009' minProcessors='5' maxProcessors='75'                 enableLookups='true' redirectPort='8443'                 acceptCount='10' debug='0' connectionTimeout='0'                 useURIValidationHack='false'                  protocolHandlerClassName='org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler'/>        <!-- Define an AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->      <!--      <Connector className='org.apache.ajp.tomcat4.Ajp13Connector'                 port='8009' minProcessors='5' maxProcessors='75'                 acceptCount='10' debug='0'/>      -->    So you need to comment out the first connector and uncomment the second one.  After that any access (even 404) will cause the problem.    (In reply to comment #6)  > To reproduce the problem you have to use  > org.apache.ajp.tomcat4.Ajp13Connector.

38403	null	RESOLVED		matthias	1138303320000	1143929758000		Child-Thread uses 100%CPU usage, mod_proxy ? This bug is probably related to #36951, however the offered solution was for 2.1.8 and not merged into 2.2.0.  Setup: Apache 2.2.0 is used as a reverse proxy for accelerating an apache1.3+php on the same host. we are using worker mdm and mod_proxy is configured to use a pool. Apache is build from current source.  Problem: At least once a day 1 or 2 threads consume 100% of their cpu (dual+ht, so system remains responsive). strace says that the process is waiting for the child  futex(0xb2b10bf8, FUTEX_WAIT, 1847, NULL <unfinished ...>  while the child (1847) is in a loop of:   close(-1)                               = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)  (the other thread did the same)  the worker-thread and its parent process remain up, even if all other worker threads of this process have been shutdown and apache already uses other processes to service requests.  ps -L -e -F UID        PID  PPID   LWP  C NLWP    SZ  RSS PSR STIME TTY          TIME CMD ... nobody    1839 19001  1839  0    3 693301 235192 3 Jan25 ?       00:00:00 /home/apache22/bin/httpd -k start nobody    1839 19001  1847 99    3 693301 235192 1 Jan25 ?       1-03:37:44 /home/apache22/bin/httpd -k start nobody    1839 19001  1928 99    3 693301 235192 2 Jan25 ?       1-03:37:54 /home/apache22/bin/httpd -k start ...

(this makes sense, as I had a 'buggy' backend server, while the other bug hat 'buggy' client.  I'm trying the patched version and get the info back here.  If this sounds like a good thing, can someone provide a patch and get this into CVS ? Sorry I'm not that good with this Could you please let me know where in the code (filename, line) you suppose the error? PR #36951 is about mod_proxy_connect. I doubt that it is used in your reverse proxy configuration. Regarding the problem getting a backtrace: You called gdb with the LWP id:  gdb httpd 1928  Try to call it with the PID of the LWP. That would be  gdb httpd -p 1839  Hope that helps. Further debugging tips can be found at: http://httpd.apache.org/dev/debugging.html Forgot one thing: Debugging can be problematic if you compiled your httpd with --enable-pie on Linux. its build without pie, however i tried to build everything static .  thx for the gdb hint, heres the output  (gdb) info threads   3 Thread -1884591184 (LWP 8768)  0xb7e7f308 in allocator_free () from /home/apache22/lib/libapr-1.so.0   2 Thread -2052428880 (LWP 8785)  0x0807b039 in ap_core_input_filter ()   1 Thread -1209833792 (LWP 8702)  0xb7f89402 in ??

May it would be helpful to replace  BRIGADE_NORMALIZE(ctx->b);  with the expanded macro to see if the loop is never left.  do {      apr_bucket *e = APR_BRIGADE_FIRST(ctx->b);      do {           if (e->length == 0 && !APR_BUCKET_IS_METADATA(e)) {              apr_bucket *d;              d = APR_BUCKET_NEXT(e);              apr_bucket_delete(e);              e = d;          }          else {              e = APR_BUCKET_NEXT(e);          }      } while (!APR_BRIGADE_EMPTY(ctx->b) && (e != APR_BRIGADE_SENTINEL(ctx->b)));  } while (0)  Furthermore it would be better to use step / next instead of stepi to check where the code circles. stepi only executes one assembler instruction, whereas step executes one line of C code.  In your initial comment to this bug you mentioned that a thread is looping with close(-1). Would it be possible to get a backtrace of this thread?  So I would recommend the following next steps:  1. Expand the BRIGADE_NORMALIZE macro and recompile. 2. If the error occurs again do a dump_brigade ctx->b and attach the output 3. Check with if the BRIGADE_NORMALIZE loop is left. For this set a breakpoint after the loop and cont. If you reach it the loop is left if not we circle in the loop. 4. Try to get a backtrace of the thread that loops with close(-1) short update: I'm still trying to hunt it down. here's a short summary:  Currently not reproducable at will, but steadily recurring about once a day.   As long as I did close looks at it, there are always 2 threads with similar stack trace ( ap_proxy_http_process_response, one ap_proxy_read_headers, the other just ap_getline ). While one is cleaning up, the other is probably stuck in BRIGADE_NORMALIZE (which also does some cleanup). Sounds like a race condition where 2 threads are cleaning up the same brigade. (I will try to get some info on the brigade that the other thread tries to cleanup, next time).   step/next did not return the last time, so the MACRO line was never left.   the strace close(-1) threads does only show up 1 in 10 times. Either its a different bug or it is about the repeated cleanup/normalization of a socket-bucket. Most of the times the threads produce no system/library calls, so I guess they are caught in a very small loop. We probably found the root of evil:  a graceful restart does destroy but not reinitialize the resource list that keeps the pooled connections. this is due to a early return in ap_proxy_initialize_worker (proxy_util.c) when called again. Our patch is not nice, but worked for us. (restart instead of graceful did it also as workaround)   --- proxy_util.c        2006-02-06 13:59:35.000000000 +0000 +++ proxy_util.c.orig   2006-02-06 17:48:39.000000000 +0000 @@ -1629,7 +1630,7 @@      int mpm_threads;  #endif  -    if (worker->s->status & PROXY_WORKER_INITIALIZED && worker->cp->res) { +    if (worker->s->status & PROXY_WORKER_INITIALIZED) {          /* The worker is already initialized */          return APR_SUCCESS;      }   We noticed this when we tried to force the 99% cpu threads by stressing the webserver with ab ( -k -c 20 ). after a graceful restart the server was likely to coredump at   proxy_util.c:1758 (*conn)->worker = worker;  because conn was null. it seems that conn is deleted be another thread. conditional breakpoints above proxy_util.c:1745 (rv = APR_SUCCESS;) never spotted a conn = 0.  before the graceful we run through this condition (no problems) but after gracefull res is null.      if (worker->hmax && worker->cp->res) {         rv = apr_reslist_acquire(worker->cp->res, (void **)conn);     }  this change in flow introduces the concurrency problems. is the else branch without the pool threadsafe or only intended for prefork ?

From my first brief into this I agree that the resource list needs to be initialized in these cases. But it seems also that your patch as you assumed isn't complete. From a first brief view I think more fixes are required. As I am still wondering whether the problem that is fixed by your patch is really the root cause of the problem you reported I would like you to keep me updated if the problem is gone with your patched httpd's. Anyway: Good work. Feedback: we are running almost a week now with the patched version. So far this server remains free of problems, except for 2 seg faults in 5 days. (so there's more to do as you said)  On the other servers in the farm I got one 99% percent process in the last 5 days and a whole bunch of segfaults.   They are all running non-patched non-debug httpds and are running on same hardware, kernel, config etc. except that they do a restart instead of graceful, which has helped so far (i thought). So if 'restart' always runs the if-branch that creates the pool, than you're right and it was not the root of OUR evil).  I also have to modify my statement that 99er only appear on graceful restarting apaches, they are just more likely to be seen there and to survive long enough to be analyzed.  We will do more testing with patched versions next week and see if we can get more insight. I'll keep you updated.

After some debugging I figured out that the frontend mod_proxy was 'canonicalizing' URLs, thereby encoding ~ as %7E. This would not be an issue but for lots of backend server software that relied on the URL passed to the backend server to be the same as the one the user saw in their browsers. Now, this is of course a bad assumption *but* I don't really know why the canonicalization happens in the first place, or even why ~ is not considered a safe character.  I have attached a patch that simply adds '~' to the set of 'reserved' characters for modules/proxy/proxy_util.c:ap_proxy_canonenc. It does the job on my site. Is there any reason not to apply it?  Note: I tried to subscribe to apache-users@ to ask around for other people experiencing this bug bug the list never confirmed my emails...	Created an attachment (id=17536) patch to reserve ~ character in mod_proxy  Here is the trivial patch. well.. guess nobody's interested either way? (In reply to comment #2) > well.. guess nobody's interested either way?  ~ may or may not be a reserved character according to which edition of the RFC  you read.  Encoding it as %7E is a safe option.  I don't see any strong reason to apply your patch (but feel free to try and  convince me).  Neither do I see any reason to close this report - it's marked  as PatchAvailable for the benefit of anyone who wants it. I changed my mind since my previous comment, and I've committed this  to /trunk/.  Thanks:-) Many thanks! That's one less customized package to maintain! Fixed in 2.2 branch (r571456).  Closing.

Setup: ./configure --enable-proxy --enable-proxy-http  Config: ProxyPass /proxy/ http://httpd.apache.org/  Testcase: #telnet localhost 80 GET /proxy/robots.txt HTTP/1.1 Host: httpd.apache.org Connection: keep-alive User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1;)   The response neither contains a Connection: nor a Keep-alive: header. However the connection remains open for 5 seconds and is then 'closed by the foreign host'. A 'GET / HTTP/1.1' returns:  Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive  talking directly to the remote server also returns these values, they only get lost passing the proxy. (this also happens when configured as forward proxy)  BTW: a 'connection: close' request header makes its way through to the backend server, which causes the connection between front and backend server to be dropped. When used to accelerate a backend server this prevents the connection from being reused for another client or the next request.	Created an attachment (id=17619) Patch against trunk  I had a look in this issue and have an idea why this happens. I still need some discussion for this patch on the dev list, but I would like to know if it fixes your problem. So could you please try the attached patch and check if it solves the problem? thanks for the quick patch, it works for me. However you also need to get rid of line 616 which already clears the connection header from the headers_in. (In reply to comment #2) > thanks for the quick patch, it works for me.

Stupid copy and paste error. Thanks for pointing it out. I will discuss the patch on the dev list and keep you in the loop.   Next stupid thing of mine: Of course its 616 in the patched version, but 620 in the unpatched one :-). I really should RTFM of patch and diff, so line numbers and order of fileargs  wouldn't be a problem ...  2 things I'm wondering as code novice about: does the copied table get freed and wouldn't it be better to just save the removed headers ?

I should have looked at the patched version :-).  >  > 2 things I'm wondering as code novice about: does the copied table get freed and  Yes, because the space is allocated from a memory pool and this pool is cleaned after the end of the request.  > wouldn't it be better to just save the removed headers ? (P.S: patch isnt't in > productive environment yet, so we don't know of possible side-effects)  In principle yes, especially if the other headers are large. I have to take a look into it whether the extra effort of doing so is justified, because several headers are removed by ap_proxy_clear_connection and it adds some work to save them and merge them back in. The full copy approach has a simpler logic and if possible I like to keep things simple :-) (In reply to comment #6)  >  > > wouldn't it be better to just save the removed headers ? (P.S: patch isnt't in > > productive environment yet, so we don't know of possible side-effects)  Meanwhile I had a closer look into this and as apr_table_copy only copies the pointers to the key / value pairs of the headers I guess we neither gain much speed (actually I think we will loose speed for a small number of headers) nor save a reasonable amount of memory (also guess that we waste memory for a low number of headers) by only saving the removed headers and merg??ng them back in later on. I keep you updated.   I committed two patches to the trunk (r377053 and r377057, http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=377053&view=rev, http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=377057&view=rev). r377053 fixes the problem with the missing keepalive headers in the response, wheras r377055 prevents the closing of the backend connection if the client send Connection: close. http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=377053&view=rev introduced a pool memory problem since I used the wrong pool for apr_table_copy. http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=377525&view=rev should fix this, but I am waiting for confirmation by other developers. I keep you updated.   It has been confirmed that http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=377525&view=rev fixes the pool memory problem. So could you please test with both patches applied and let me know the results?

38602	null	RESOLVED		Jean Dagenais	1139546160000	1141763753000		Keep Alive not workwing with mod_proxy (New socket created for every request proxied) We are testing Apache 2.2 before migrating to this new release, and we found  out that Apache does not keep sockets open with or other server (JBoss 3.2).  The same configuration is working fine on Apache 2.0.55.  We tried with both worker and prefork MPM, and this is the same behavior.  Apache is runing on Red Hat AS 4.0, Update2, 64 Bit, on a Dell Dual Core 1850.   The Keep-Alive connection between the IE Brower and Apache works OK, and no  socket is created between multiple requests, but every requests sent(proxied)  between Apache and JBoss cause a new socket to be created.  IE includes the HTTP header: Connection: Keep-Alive, but Apache does not send  it to JBosss.

To quote the spec:  'A significant difference between HTTP/1.1 and earlier versions of HTTP is that persistent connections are the default behavior of any HTTP connection. That is, unless otherwise indicated, the client SHOULD assume that the server will maintain a persistent connection, even after error responses from the server.'  So in this case IE is sending a Keep-Alive header to try to get persistent connections even if it's talking to an HTTP/1.0 server that supports them. It's not needed for HTTP/1.1 servers.  Anyway, it looks to me like you probably are getting persistent connections between Apache and JBoss, which I infer from the HTTP/1.1 in the request and response headers and more specifically from the lack of a 'Connection: close' header from JBoss. ('Connection: close' is how an HTTP/1.1 server says it wants to close the TCP connection)  This is not conclusive, though. The Ultimate Test, of course - and what I recommend - is to look at the TCP conversation between your hosts (e.g. with Ethereal or Tethereal) to see whether TCP connections really are being closed after each request. I did a trace with Ethereal, and the socket connection between IE and Apache  is kept open, but a new socket is used between Apache and JBoss for each  exchange.  IE Is running on 198.252.177.123 Apache is running on 198.252.177.38 JBOss is running on 198.252.177.19  No.     Time        Source                Destination           Protocol Info      16 0.250856    198.252.177.123       198.252.177.38        HTTP      GET /jmsproxy/company/jmsproxy/u.jsp?diagnum=221      17 0.000203    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11970  > 8080 [SYN] Seq=0 Ack=0 Win=5840 Len=0 MSS=1460 TSV=8098330 TSER=0 WS=9      18 0.000053    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        TCP      8080  > 11970 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=5792 Len=0 MSS=1460 TSV=30418315  TSER=8098330 WS=9      19 0.000022    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11970  > 8080 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=6144 Len=0 TSV=8098330 TSER=30418315      20 0.000066    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        HTTP      GET /jmsproxy/company/jmsproxy/u.jsp?diagnum=221      21 0.000156    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        TCP      8080  > 11970 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=858 Win=7680 Len=0 TSV=30418316 TSER=8098330      22 0.102066    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        HTTP      HTTP/1.1 200 OK      23 0.000011    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11970  > 8080 [ACK] Seq=858 Ack=257 Win=7168 Len=0 TSV=8098432 TSER=30418418      24 0.000086    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11970  > 8080 [FIN, ACK] Seq=858 Ack=257 Win=7168 Len=0 TSV=8098432 TSER=30418418      25 0.000041    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.123       HTTP      HTTP/1.1 200 OK      26 0.000114    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        TCP      8080  > 11970 [FIN, ACK] Seq=257 Ack=859 Win=7680 Len=0 TSV=30418418 TSER=8098432      27 0.000010    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11970  > 8080 [ACK] Seq=859 Ack=258 Win=7168 Len=0 TSV=8098432 TSER=30418418      28 0.217864    198.252.177.123       198.252.177.38        TCP      1578  > http [ACK] Seq=1493 Ack=512 Win=16656 Len=0        29 0.091197    198.252.177.123       198.252.177.38        HTTP      GET /jmsproxy/company/jmsproxy/u.jsp?diagnum=222      30 0.000145    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11971  > 8080 [SYN] Seq=0 Ack=0 Win=5840 Len=0 MSS=1460 TSV=8098741 TSER=0 WS=9      31 0.000107    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        TCP      8080  > 11971 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=5792 Len=0 MSS=1460 TSV=30418727  TSER=8098741 WS=9      32 0.000014    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11971  > 8080 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=6144 Len=0 TSV=8098742 TSER=30418727      33 0.000064    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        HTTP      GET /jmsproxy/company/jmsproxy/u.jsp?diagnum=222      34 0.000170    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        TCP      8080  > 11971 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=857 Win=7680 Len=0 TSV=30418728 TSER=8098742      35 0.102191    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        HTTP      HTTP/1.1 200 OK      36 0.000009    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11971  > 8080 [ACK] Seq=857 Ack=257 Win=7168 Len=0 TSV=8098844 TSER=30418830      37 0.000079    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11971  > 8080 [FIN, ACK] Seq=857 Ack=257 Win=7168 Len=0 TSV=8098844 TSER=30418830      38 0.000041    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.123       HTTP      HTTP/1.1 200 OK      39 0.000122    198.252.177.19        198.252.177.38        TCP      8080  > 11971 [FIN, ACK] Seq=257 Ack=858 Win=7680 Len=0 TSV=30418830 TSER=8098844      40 0.000009    198.252.177.38        198.252.177.19        TCP      11971  > 8080 [ACK] Seq=858 Ack=258 Win=7168 Len=0 TSV=8098844 TSER=30418830   I am also trying to used pooled connection to the backend,   e.g. ProxyPass /example http://backend.example.com min=20 max=50   and I was wondering why I do not see these 20 connections created when I start  the Apache server? Does it require a Proxy message do be received before  creating these connections? A patch against trunk has been created (r378032, http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=378032&view=rev). Could you please give it a try? Please keep in mind that there is a further keepalive bug with mod_proxy on the client side of the connection (#38524). I verified the patch, and it solve the issues with Keep Alive connections.  The connections are kept open, and the Keep-Alive header is passed to the  JBoss server.  Thanks a lot!

38737	null	RESOLVED		Chris Darroch	1140542820000	1148668547000		keepalives may cause worker MPM on linux to stall during shutdown I covered much of the background on this in the following mailing list thread:  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=113986864730305&w=2  The usual firestorm of discussion broke out ... anyway, as I noted, it's important to me that even if I issue an ungraceful restart or shutdown that the MPM manages, if at all possible, to call apr_pool_destroy(pchild).  Otherwise, important cleanup functions that are registered against the pool don't get invoked; in my case, that's the DB disconnection cleanups in mod_dbd/apr_dbd.  To summarize, on Linux, poll() doesn't immediately return with EBADF if another thread closes the socket descriptor, as described here:  http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=546  When a worker thread is running process_socket(), after handling the request it then waits for the specified Keep-Alive period.  This is actually done inside the apr_bucket_read() in ap_rgetline_core(); the apr_socket_recv() function runs apr_wait_for_io_or_timeout(), which performs a poll() for the Keep-Alive period.   When an ungraceful restart or shutdown message is received by the worker MPM, it uses close_worker_sockets() to close all the sockets the worker threads might be polling on.  On Solaris, for example, that has the side-effect of immediately causing apr_wait_for_io_or_timeout() to return EBADF, which curtails all the calling functions until process_socket() returns and the worker thread notices the workers_may_exit flag and exits.  That in turn allows join_workers() to run to completion, after which clean_child_exit() can run the cleanups on the pchild pool and all child memory pools.  But on Linux, the worker child process is stuck waiting for the Keep-Alive period for the polling to timeout, and during this period, the main httpd process often decides the child process is non-responsive, and sends SIGKILL.  For me, that means my important cleanup functions never run.  The attached patch is the simplest fix I've found; it turns out that by simply signalling the worker threads with any signal is sufficient, because then poll() wakes up and returns EBADF (because the socket descriptor has been closed).  At first I assumed poll() would return EINTR, but luckily, that's not the case, so the fix gets that much simpler.	Created an attachment (id=17761) signals worker threads after closing their sockets  Created an attachment (id=17762) same again for event MPM  (From update of attachment 17762) Actually, this isn't needed because of the asynchronous polling on Keep-Alives.  Committed to 2.3 HEAD:  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=409715 Created an attachment (id=18355) patch for current 2.2.x branch 			Chris Darroch
38793	null	RESOLVED		matthias	1141061460000	1145719710000		Segfault when backend failes, threading issue We run apache22 as reverse proxy to a backend application server (apache1.3). When we put apache22 under load ( ab -k -c 200 ) and restart the backend server, there's a good chance of a segmentation fault.   We've done multiple runs and all Segfault backtraces shared the  proxy_http_handler in mod_proxy_http.c with calls between the comments 'Step One' and 'Step Six'. The attached backtrace is the most common one.   My guess is, that when the first connection fails, it clears pooled connections/ressources currently being used by other threads that are already in the code between 'Step One' and 'Step Six', so their backend->connection gets nulled in the middle of doing something. In my opinion backend->connection should never be 0 in this part of the code, since all failed functions would goto cleanup. However backtrace shows them 0 as well as some cond breakpoints. (Although sometimes breakpoints get passed, but thread segfaults anyway).     #0  0x08095f79 in ap_proxy_make_fake_req (c=0x0, r=0x19520540) at proxy_util.c:351         rp = (request_rec *) 0x94d53f0

some more debugging and found a strange behaviour in ap_proxy_connect_backend  #0  ap_proxy_connect_backend (proxy_function=0x80d5ff9 'HTTP', conn=0x9d0cfd8, worker=0x9c95db0, s=0x9d154c8) at

on the return statement in case that conn->sock is null, however the function will return true, because its internal newsock is valid and its connected counter is 1. (see stacktrace above). conn looks magically empty:  (gdb) inspect conn->hostname $4 = 0x0 (gdb) inspect conn->port $5 = 0 (gdb) inspect conn->pool $6 = (apr_pool_t *) 0x9d60768 (gdb) inspect conn->is_ssl $7 = 0 (gdb) inspect conn->sock $8 = (apr_socket_t *) 0x0 (gdb) inspect conn->addr $9 = (apr_sockaddr_t *) 0x0 (gdb) inspect conn->flags $10 = 0 (gdb) inspect conn->close $11 = 0 (gdb) inspect conn->close_on_recycle $12 = 0 (gdb) inspect conn->worker $13 = (proxy_worker *) 0x9c95db0  connected is only set right after conn->sock = newsock , both vars are never touched until return then. How does conn become so empty ? I also do not have any of the error messages from ap_proxy_connect_backend in the error_log, so I assume the bad boy might be another thread.  I get the following error messages from other threads and they are already int the logfile when the above breakpoint is hit, so chances are that things get messed up here.  [Sat Mar 04 18:12:48 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: error reading status line from remote server (null) [Sat Mar 04 18:12:48 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: Error reading from remote server returned by /test/output.php  above this errormessage is  ap_proxy_http_cleanup(NULL, r, backend); which i think is redundant as proxy_http_handler runs cleanup: anyway. removing did not fix the problem.   Let me know if this looks like something to go into deeper. (PS. We are running mod_worker)  Created an attachment (id=17836) Temporary debug patch to narrow down the problem.  Could you please apply the attached patch temporarily and set the LogLevel to debug? A conn data structure should be only leased to one thread at the same time from the connection pool. So in theory different threads should not have access to the same data structure at the same time. The patch logs the aquire and release operations and hopefully helps to see if this is not the case. switch loglevel to debug eliminates problem ( probably because of a change in timing because of the additional overhead).  I changed the patch to log as ERROR. I grepped the logfile for the segfaulting backend and all non 'backend' messages:  [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] proxy: HTTP: Aquired backend 0x987bff8 for request 0xa9e20540, connection 0xaa01ab08, pid 13549, tid 0xb4184bb0 [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] proxy: HTTP: Released backend 0x987bff8 for request 0xa9e20540, connection 0xaa01ab08, pid 13549, tid 0xb4184bb0 [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: error reading status line from remote server (null) [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: Error reading from remote server returned by /test/output.php [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] proxy: HTTP: Released backend 0x987bff8 for request 0xa9e20540, connection 0xaa01ab08, pid 13549, tid 0xb4184bb0 [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: error reading status line from remote server (null) [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: Error reading from remote server returned by /test/output.php [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: error reading status line from remote server (null) [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: Error reading from remote server returned by /test/output.php [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: error reading status line from remote server (null) [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: Error reading from remote server returned by /test/output.php [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: error reading status line from remote server (null) [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: Error reading from remote server returned by /test/output.php [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] proxy: HTTP: Aquired backend 0x987bff8 for request 0xaa034be8, connection 0xaa030d90, pid 13549, tid 0xadd7abb0 [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] proxy: HTTP: Aquired backend 0x987bff8 for request 0xa9e2a568, connection 0xaa018a90, pid 13549, tid 0xaf17cbb0 [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] proxy: HTTP: Released backend 0x987bff8 for request 0xa9e2a568, connection 0xaa018a90, pid 13549, tid 0xaf17cbb0 [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: error reading status line from remote server (null) [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] proxy: Error reading from remote server returned by /test/output.php [Mon Mar 06 19:37:35 2006] [error] proxy: HTTP: Released backend 0x987bff8 for request 0xa9e2a568, connection 0xaa018a90, pid 13549, tid 0xaf17cbb0  The backend gets released, 'error reading status line' gets logged, and the same backend gets released again. Afterwards it gets acquired by 2 different threads.  One thread fails with same error (0xaf17cbb0) releasing the backend, the other thread gets the segfault (0xadd7abb0) while in ap_proxy_connection_create. (gdb bt).  I suspect   ap_proxy_http_cleanup(NULL, r, backend)   in line 1220 ( and 1246, numbers my vary because of your patch ) of mod_proxy_http.c to be the problem, as mentioned in previous comment, it gets called there and again in line 1741, after the cleanup:-goto.  I don't know what the proxy_function argument means in line 1741, because the other cleanups are called with NULL ?    Removing line 1220 eliminates the Segfaults. But I get these lines after some time running ab:  (99)Cannot assign requested address: proxy: HTTP: attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1:8081 (127.0.0.1) failed  I guess this could be related to a temporary shortage of tcp-ip source ports (I'm running ab from the same machine and it never happens for the first 20000 requests) BTW: this also fixes the ' remote server (null) ' thing of the error line. see also: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37770#c2   Many thanks for the update. It was very helpful. The problem seems to be caused by the fact that apr_reslist_release does not notice 'double releases' (see also http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apr-dev&m=114168465029319&w=2). I am checking now if this is a bug inside apr-util or inside the proxy code. If it is a bug inside the proxy code, I need to implement additional measures to prevent such 'double releases' (apart from removing the unnecessary double calls to ap_proxy_http_cleanup which you already mentioned). These additional measures should help track down such issues faster in the future and prevent the server from segfaulting in such situations. I'll keep you updated. Created an attachment (id=17874) Patch against trunk to fix double return of connections to pool  I created a patch that removes the double calls to ap_proxy_http_cleanup and adds a check if a connection has been already returned to the connection pool before. Could you please give the patch a try and let me know if this fixes your problem and if you do not see any error messages of 'proxy: Pooled connection 0x%pp for worker %s has been already returned to the connection pool.'. Thanks.  We applied the patch about 10 days ago, no double-free warnings so far. Crash is no longer reproducable with ab in test environment.   However we are still seeing segfaults in our logfiles in production use. I have the suspect it might be related to mod_ssl, but I did not have time to look into this so far.   So this patch is probably ready to roll, although there's more to do ... Committed patch to trunk as r394088 (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=394088&view=rev). Proposed for backport to 2.2.x as r394653 (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=394653&view=rev). Backported to 2.2.x as r396049 ( http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=396049&view=rev).

38848	null	RESOLVED		Ronnie Brunner	1141430640000	1192085840000		httpd -X option broken If httpd is running in single process debug mode (-X commandline option), it does not properly respond to stop (SIGTERM), graceful (SIGUSR1), graceful-stop (SIGWINCH) and probably other signals.  Except for a kill -9, the process cannot be terminated anymore and there is no way to properly shutdown the process.  (BTW: I guess it's on newer versions as well but I didn't know hoe to cekc out working head version of either 2.2 or 2.3)	FWIW I'm seeing the same thing on Darwin on my Powerbook.   Control-C (which I think sends a SIGINT) also doesn't give me a reaction. It's as if we go through the  trouble of ignoring the signals (default for most signals is to terminate the program), but don't register  handlers when in -X mode.   Interestingly, httpd reacts to ^C when run under -X. Maybe gdb plants its own handler?   Trunk is also affected.

38910	null	RESOLVED		Robby Griffin	1141922520000	1147876818000		mod_autoindex prints unescaped filenames In the default configuration of Apache httpd-2.2.0, filenames printed by mod_autoindex are not properly html-escaped. This can inject arbitrary html directly in the autoindex output, potentially making it unusable for navigation purposes. For example:  [build, install, and run httpd-2.2.0] cd $PREFIX/htdocs mkdir foo touch 'foo/<body onload=alert(1)>' [visit /foo/ in a browser (tested with Firefox)] [an alert dialog appears]  Earlier versions of Apache httpd do contain this bug, but are not affected in their default configurations. The difference is that versions prior to 2.2.0 have 'IndexOptions FancyIndexing' enabled in the default httpd.conf, so a different code path is used to display the filenames.  Here's a patch against 2.2.0 (and probably applicable to earlier versions) which adds the necessary escaping to the displayed filename in non-fancy, non-table autoindex output. I'll include it inline because I don't see how to attach a file in Bugzilla.  --- httpd-2.2.0/modules/generators/mod_autoindex.c.orig\tThu Nov 10 09:20:05 2005 +++ httpd-2.2.0/modules/generators/mod_autoindex.c\tThu Mar  9 02:42:54 2006 @@ -1819,8 +1819,9 @@              ap_rputc('/n', r);          }          else { -            ap_rvputs(r, '<li><a href=/'', anchor, '/'> ', t2, -                         '</a></li>/n', NULL); +            ap_rvputs(r, '<li><a href=/'', anchor, '/'> ', +                      ap_escape_html(scratch, t2), +                      '</a></li>/n', NULL);          }      }      if (autoindex_opts & TABLE_INDEXING) {	Created an attachment (id=17857) adds proper html escaping  Ok, fine, so I can add an attachment after first creating the bug report.

39203	null	RESOLVED		Che Wang	1144174320000	1156294238000		mod_proxy_balancer does not treat trailing slash like Proxypass directive Running httpd-2.2.0-1 on CentOS 4.3 (rebuilt source rpm package).  Found a bug with mod_proxy_balancer module where it does not treat a URL the same as mod_proxy module would.  Using Apache as a reverse proxy with mod_proxy module passing this directive to a single backend server works just fine:  ProxyPass /KenwoodAccess/ http://172.20.111.33:80/KenwoodAccess/  This next example is a WORKING configuration for mod_proxy_balancer. No errors are generated in Apache and passes to the backend servers:  ProxyPass /KenwoodAccess balancer://KWA_cluster lbmethod=byrequests stickysession=JSESSIONID nofailover=off <Proxy balancer://KWA_cluster>         BalancerMember http://172.20.111.33:80/KenwoodAccess smax=15 loadfactor=1         BalancerMember http://172.20.111.34:80/KenwoodAccess smax=15 loadfactor=1         #BalancerMember http://test.kenwoodaccess.com/noworkers.html smax=15 loadfactor=80 </Proxy>  Where the bug happens:  ProxyPass /KenwoodAccess/ balancer://KWA_cluster lbmethod=byrequests *NOTE: The trailing slash in the first option.  This will generate an error message in Apache logs:  [Mon Apr 03 17:04:55 2006] [warn] proxy: No protocol handler was valid for the URL /site/images/buts/forgotpassword.gif. If you are using a DSO version of mod_proxy, make sure the proxy submodules are included in the configuration using LoadModule.  This error message seems to be misleading when passing options using the trailing slash.  How I am interpreting it is mod_proxy_balancer doesn't want to call on other mod_proxy submodules properly.  Googling shows that people resolved this Apache error message by adding 'LoadModule' for the submodules of mod_proxy (ie: mod_proxy_connect, mod_proxy_http, etc.).  This is not the case with me, since Apache shows these submodules as loaded:  httpd -M  proxy_module (shared)  proxy_connect_module (shared)  proxy_ftp_module (shared)  proxy_http_module (shared)  proxy_ajp_module (shared)  proxy_balancer_module (shared)  This has been troubleshooted down to trailing slashes as the culprit for mod_proxy_balancer and mod_proxy Proxypass directive works just fine with trailing slashes.	  > ProxyPass /KenwoodAccess/ http://172.20.111.33:80/KenwoodAccess/  and  > ProxyPass /KenwoodAccess/ balancer://KWA_cluster lbmethod=byrequests  are different cases. In the first case you have a trailing slash at both ends in the second case you do not have this.   > This will generate an error message in Apache logs: >  > [Mon Apr 03 17:04:55 2006] [warn] proxy: No protocol handler was valid for the > URL /site/images/buts/forgotpassword.gif.

Please set also the LogLevel to debug and attach the output of your error_log file. *** Bug 39206 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I had the same issue, and this does not necessarily mean that is not a bug but I have at least discovered a workaround.  In my case, within a certain Virtual Host I pass all requests to the Load Balancer. This received the same errors when configured as follows:  ProxyPass / balancer://cluster nofailover=On ProxyPassReverse / balancer://cluster <Proxy balancer://cluster>   BalancerMember ajp://10.0.1.102:8009   BalancerMember ajp://10.0.1.103:8009 </Proxy>  But works if the configuration is changed to this:  ProxyPass / balancer://cluster/ nofailover=On ProxyPassReverse / balancer://cluster/ <Proxy balancer://cluster/>   BalancerMember ajp://10.0.1.102:8009/   BalancerMember ajp://10.0.1.103:8009/ </Proxy>  I agree that the error message is misleading, but this problem is not limited to mod_proxy_balancer and the balancer scheme but also occurs with  ProxyPass / http://www.somewhere.com  (it must be ProxyPass / http://www.somewhere.com/)  So the problem is really a misconfiguration on the user side that I mark as a WONTFIX.

Ok, agreed, but strictly speaking only the balancer example is wrong.   ProxyPass /example http://backend.example.com  is correct again. The basic rule for this is:  If the left side of ProxyPass ends with a / the right side must also end with a /. If the right side of ProxyPass ends with a / but the left side does not this will cause // in the URL send to the backend which usually does not harm, but to play safe both sides really should end in the same manner. Maybe an idea for a sanity check that issues a warning to the error log during the configuration parsing of the ProxyPass directives if this is not the case.

39245	null	RESOLVED		Jeff Tharp	1144442160000	1176365922000		Mod_proxy_http ProxyErrorOverride eating cookies From a post on the Apache httpd-dev mailing list: Hi,  The 'ProxyErrorOverride On' setting is correctly catching the errors from the (reverse) proxied server. Only, it overrides too much IMHO. Right now it overrides anything that's not in the 2xx range, but I think it should allow also the 3xx range for redirects etc.  A commonly used 'trick' is to set a cookie with a 302 header so the browser gets redirected to the page which 'needs' the cookie. When using ProxyErrorOverride, mod_proxy_http sets its own headers and the cookie is lost.  The attached patch check not only for ap_is_HTTP_SUCCESS but also for ap_is_HTTP_REDIRECT which should solve the problem.  Thanks, Bart van der Schans  I can second this claim, as we also see it with our applications, most notably when attempting to reverse proxy the login process of SAP E-Recruiting, IBM WebSphere Portal Server, and Roller (http://rollerweblogger.org/page/project).  I have attached the patch proposed by the original poster.

Regards, Bart Have you tried to set a custom error document? Can you check if  ErrorDocument 301 /dummy.html ErrorDocument 302 /dummy.html ErrorDocument 303 /dummy.html  fixes your problem? Of course dummy.html must be a file in your document root. Finally able to work on this bug again.  Tested this behavior using version 2.2.3 and it looks like the issue is now resolved.  Cookies are correctly set on 302 redirect requests with ProxyErrorOverride On.  I suspect changes elsewhere cleaned up this issue since the bug was first reported. NOT FIXED in vanilla 2.2.3.   I'm using mod_proxy_http to reverse proxy a resin application server. Cookies and most headers set by resin in a 302 response are dropped by 2.2.3 when proxyerroroverride is on.   What follows are transcripts with our internal 2.2.3 server; the first transcript is with proxyerroroverride on in the specified virtual host config; the second with proxyerroroverride off.

Update: we applied Bart's proposed patch, with line numbers modified to suit 2.2.3, and it solved the problem for us.   So with proxyerroroverride On and patched 2.2.3, we are able to pass cookies back from a resin app server serving 302 responses over http.  Very good!  *** Bug 41601 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I can confirm this is indeed NOT FIXED in httpd 2.2.4.  I had thought it was based on some tests I did earlier, but today we had application who displayed the exact same symptoms as others have reported...when issuing a 302 redirect with ProxyErrorOverride On, the Set-Cookie header was lost.  I used the patch from Bug ID 41601 submitted by Stuart Children as this was updated for 2.2.4.  I can confirm that applying this patch fixed my problem...could this patch please be applied to both trunk and/or 2.2? I don't think this can reasonably be described as a bug: rather it's documented behaviour of ProxyErrorOverride.  We can't apply the suggested patch, because it breaks that.  *You* can of course apply the patch yourself, since it's the behaviour you want.  However, it's a reasonable enhancement request, to provide an option to preserve *headers* from the backend while substituting a local response *body*.  Simple solution: if you want your cookies from the backend, don't override them.  (In reply to comment #8) > I don't think this can reasonably be described as a bug: rather it's > documented behaviour of ProxyErrorOverride.  Huh? http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyerroroverride  [quote] This directive is useful for reverse-proxy setups, where you want to have a common look and feel on the error pages seen by the end user. This also allows for included files (via mod_include's SSI) to get the error code and act accordingly (default behavior would display the error page of the proxied server, turning this on shows the SSI Error message). [/quote]  Since when are redirects considered errors?  This bug is a *regression* in behaviour from 2.0.x.  > However, it's a reasonable enhancement request, to provide an option to > preserve *headers* from the backend while substituting a local response > *body*.  We (well, I) don't want that. We want the entire proxied request to be left alone, because there's nothing wrong with it! Don't replace the body with the ErrorDocument, don't remove the headers.  > Simple solution: if you want your cookies from the backend, don't override > them.  I'm not... Clearly the documentation is not explicit enough here to define how the implementation should act; I'd certainly agree that not treating 3xx response as 'errors' for the purposes of ProxyErrorOverride would be the obvious default.  Are you sure this is a regression since vanilla 2.0.x Stuart?  AFAICT the 2.0.x code will override errors for any non-2xx response too. (In reply to comment #10) > Clearly the documentation is not explicit enough here to define how the > implementation should act; I'd certainly agree that not treating 3xx response > as 'errors' for the purposes of ProxyErrorOverride would be the obvious > default.  Yes, granted it does give a definition of 'error pages' - but as you seem to agree, most people would not take that to include redirects (or 304 responses come to that).  > Are you sure this is a regression since vanilla 2.0.x Stuart?  AFAICT the > 2.0.x code will override errors for any non-2xx response too.  Granted we do apply patches and our own modules to the server I saw this on (when just upgrading the httpd version and looking for broken things), but I'm pretty sure none of those would affect this area of behaviour. However, I have confirmed that (see below).  The 2.0.x code is actually pretty confused, and potentially broken in other ways. Within ap_proxy_http_process_response  we see:      * if we are overriding the errors, we can't put the content     * of the page into the brigade     */     if ( (conf->error_override ==0) || r->status < 400 ) {  Which would be correct in my book (though better expressed using the macros). But then later:      if ( conf->error_override ) {         /* the code above this checks for 'OK' which is what the hook expects */         if ( r->status == HTTP_OK )             return OK;         else  {             int status = r->status;             r->status = HTTP_OK;             /* Discard body, if one is expected */             if ((status > 199) && /* not any 1xx response */                 (status != HTTP_NO_CONTENT) && /* not 204 */                 (status != HTTP_RESET_CONTENT) && /* not 205 */                 (status != HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED)) { /* not 304 */                ap_discard_request_body(rp);            }             return status;         }     } else          return OK;  which would seem to indicate that only 200 would ever be considered a non-error response (even more wrong I hope you'll agree)!  However, there is something more going on - which I've not had time to follow through/debug as yet.

I think that this is caused by the backend server trying to stream its body out, and the frontend server not consuming it - possibly a seperate issue. Why the custom header comes through in 2.2.4 and not in 2.0.5 I haven't looked into - but the fact that GET and HEAD give you different headers would seem to be a bug with each version yes?  Anyway, applying my patch to 2.2.4:  $ curl --get --verbose http://localhost:2204/rproxy/redirect * About to connect() to localhost port 2204 *   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 2204 > GET /rproxy/redirect HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.15.5 (i686-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.15.5 OpenSSL/0.9.8b zlib/1.2.3 libidn/0.6.5 > Host: localhost:2204 > Accept: */* >  < HTTP/1.1 302 Found < Date: Thu, 15 Feb 2007 18:30:59 GMT < Server: Apache/2.2.4 (Unix) < X-My-Secret-Header: moo < Location: http://httpd.apache.org/ < Content-Length: 208 < Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC '-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN'> <html><head> <title>302 Found</title> </head><body> <h1>Found</h1> <p>The document has moved <a href='http://httpd.apache.org/'>here</a>.</p> </body></html> * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact * Closing connection #0  So it now passes the header through correctly. Also, the HEAD is now the same:  $ curl --head --verbose http://localhost:2204/rproxy/redirect * About to connect() to localhost port 2204 *   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 2204 > HEAD /rproxy/redirect HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.15.5 (i686-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.15.5 OpenSSL/0.9.8b zlib/1.2.3 libidn/0.6.5 > Host: localhost:2204 > Accept: */* >  < HTTP/1.1 302 Found HTTP/1.1 302 Found < Date: Thu, 15 Feb 2007 18:31:37 GMT Date: Thu, 15 Feb 2007 18:31:37 GMT < Server: Apache/2.2.4 (Unix) Server: Apache/2.2.4 (Unix) < X-My-Secret-Header: moo X-My-Secret-Header: moo < Location: http://httpd.apache.org/ Location: http://httpd.apache.org/ < Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1  * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact * Closing connection #0  And the 'pause' has gone - hence my theory.  I think the above all indicates:  1) 2.2.x has different behaviour from 2.0.x (as myself - and others it would seem - were expecting/relying on that, I call it a regression) in how they treat 3xx response when erroroveride is on. 2) Both branches may have a bug with HEAD not being the same as GET. 3) There's a potential issue left with bodies not being consumed (?)   I'll look further into 2) and 3) tomorrow, if time allows. Have been stuck in meetings most of this afternoon, it's past home time, and I've looked at this enough already for one day. :) (In reply to comment #11) > Yes, granted it does give a definition of 'error pages' - but as you seem to > agree, most people would not take that to include redirects (or 304 responses > come to that).  Sigh, see what happens when you're tired. That should obviously read:  it does *not* give a definition of 'error pages' (In reply to comment #11) > 2) Both branches may have a bug with HEAD not being the same as GET.  This one is slightly complex. See bug #41646  > 3) There's a potential issue left with bodies not being consumed (?)   Relatively straight-forward. See bug #41644  I think these are all independent issues (well, they are related in the block of code the affect which makes for confusion testing when you start discovering them, but they can be resolved on their own).

After enabling mod_cache via the mod_mem_cache storage engine MIME types for  html files revert to the DefaultType directive even if a force type directive  has been placed in the http.conf file. The only file type I actually tested  this on was a .css file in which the mime types file had a definition, there  was an AddType declaration%, and a ForceType declaration on ALL CSS files. I  had to improvise and disable caching on all files that this bug could  interfere with.

I would like to, but if I am correct I can't just add that to the module  seeing as it is already pre-compiled and I am on a Windows system. I  appologize, but I don't have much proficiency with C/C++ programming. If you  could give me the mod_mem_cache.so module for Windows with that patch applied  I would be happy to give it a try. Ok, scratch that. I downloaded the source and applied the patch to the proper  section of the file, now the only problem is how exactly do I go about  compiling the updated file? You need to recompile the whole server, but you do not need to exchange anything more then the mod_mem_cache file within your installed server with the one that came out of your compilation.

39420	null	RESOLVED		Eric	1146103260000	1166189706000		FilterProvider ignores resp prefix. There is a bug in FilterProvider directive of mod_filter.  It will not work properly if 'resp' is specified. It will match everything instead of only the header specified.  eg. FilterProvider COMPRESS DEFLATE resp=Content-Type $text/html  will cause the deflate filter to be applied to everything, regardless of if  the content-type matched or not.  It works properly only if 'resp=' is omitted.  eg. the following will only apply the filter to text/html FilterProvider COMPRESS DEFLATE Content-Type $text/html	It seems that the code path that handles the 'resp=' case (around line 640) in 2.2.2 does not invoke ap_str_tolower(str). If you add this line, then things start to work a lot better. However, I am not sure whether this should be added for all cases, or only for the resp= case. Hence I am not proposing a patch. The documentation (mod/mod_filter.html) gives the following example  FilterDeclare SSI FilterProvider SSI INCLUDES resp=Content-Type $text/html FilterChain SSI  as despatch is currently case sensitive and needs to be lower case to work, changing the documentation to the following could help  FilterDeclare SSI FilterProvider SSI INCLUDES resp=content-type $text/html FilterChain SSI Fixed in /trunk/ and 2.2.4.

This is due to this piece of code:  mod_authnz_ldap.c  static authn_status authn_ldap_check_password(request_rec *r, const char *user,                                               const char *password) { ...         return (LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT == result) ?

This can be corrected by modifying to:  #ifdef LDAP_SECURITY_ERROR                  : (LDAP_SECURITY_ERROR(result)) ? AUTH_DENIED #else \t\t\t\t : LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_AUTH == result ?

AUTH_DENIED #endif	Fixed in trunk and proposed for backport Bug observed as well on Sun Solaris 5.8. Apparently, LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_RIGHTS isn't defined neither in Sun sdk. LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS may be used instead. The abstraction of this error message in APR-util in apr_ldap_init.h   needs to be fixed, mod_authnz_ldap shouldn't be including toolkit specific #defines anywhere. The abstraction has been added to apr-util.  It is called  APU_LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS.  But we can't use it in mod_authnz_ldap.c until  a suitable libaprutil has been released.  So for now, mod_authnz_ldap.c has to  include #defines. Backported to 2.2.x as r425731 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=425731&view=rev).			Brad Nicholes	Damien Lachuer	Graham Leggett	Ruediger Pluem
39593	null	RESOLVED		Michael Han	1147813680000	1153749688000		mod_cache always misses mod_proxy_http files over SSL I have Apache 2.2.2 with mod_ssl, mod_proxy (and mod_proxy_http) and mod_cache (both mem & disk) on a RedHat EL4 U3 box. I have SSL termination enabled on my _default_:443 vhost and proxypass to HTTP on a backend Apache server. Files retrieved from the proxy endpoint are 100% cache miss in mod_cache. Relevant vhost configuration stanza looks like:  SSLProxyEngine On ProxyRequests Off ProxyPass /s5/ http://rcdev1ws14/ CacheEnable disk / CacheEnable disk http://rcdev1ws14/ CacheEnable mem / CacheEnable mem http://rcdev1ws14/ CacheRoot /var/run/httpd/cache CacheDirLength 1 CacheDirLevels 1 MCacheSize 20480 # The following are me getting increasingly desparate to make mod_cache hit CacheIgnoreCacheControl On CacheStorePrivate On CacheStoreNoStore On CacheIgnoreHeaders User-Agent Accept Max-Forwards X-Forwarded-For X-Forwarded-Host X-Forwarded-Server Cookie Vary  What's interesting is that the same configuration directives on my _default_:80 vhost works properly. The cache hits.  I added additional debugging statements to mod_cache (inline diff included below). Requesting the same file twice in a row, I grabbed the debug logs and have included them below (removed ssl_engine_io and ssl_engine_shmcb class messages, as they appear to be useless for current purposes). Notice that URL canonicalisation is occurring AFTER mod_disk_cache attempts to look up the file in cache, but then stores the file using a key generated from the canonicalised URL. Clearly this must be the problem's root cause. I'm unclear about what needs to be changed, though.  <<EndOfLogOutput [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [info] [client 172.16.0.44] Connection to child 2 established (server rcdev1ws18:443) [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [info] Seeding PRNG with 648 bytes of entropy [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1752): OpenSSL: Handshake: start [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: before/accept initialization [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 read client hello A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 write server hello A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 write certificate A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 write server done A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 flush data [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 read client key exchange A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 read finished A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 write change cipher spec A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 write finished A [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1760): OpenSSL: Loop: SSLv3 flush data [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1598): Inter-Process Session Cache: request=SET status=OK id=150FA988C7DB59F6F35666ECF91FD055478CC00399AEA87E4E6E803D8A275A10 timeout=300s (session caching) [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [debug] ssl_engine_kernel.c(1756): OpenSSL: Handshake: done [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [info] Connection: Client IP: 172.16.0.44, Protocol: TLSv1, Cipher: RC4-SHA (128/128 bits) [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [info] Initial (No.1) HTTPS request received for child 2 (server rcdev1ws18:443) [Tue May 16 14:07:20 2006] [error] disk_cache: Failed to open file /var/run/httpd/cache/b/DgKJmDvOggzqD69@NEvzQ.header.

I can confirm it. Could you please give the attached patch a try? It is against trunk, but also works against httpd 2.2.2. Created an attachment (id=18296) Patch against trunk  I saw that bug and even tried backing out the patch from the 2.2.2 code. But the patch you provided seems to work fine. Thanks! Commited to trunk as r407357 (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=407268&view=rev). Thanks for testing. Proposed for backport to 2.2.x as r409425 (http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=409425&view=rev). Backported to 2.2.x as r425035 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=425035&view=rev).			Michael Han	Ruediger Pluem

39647	null	RESOLVED		Christopher Shumway	1148416260000	1171036521000		mod_cache sets incorrect Content-type headers for cached context with backend httpd 1.3.33 and mod_jk 1.2.15 This is similar, but does not appear to be the same as bug 39266.  I've applied the patch to mod_mem_cache.c and it makes no diffrence.  It also does not matter if the storage for mod_cache is disk or memory cache.  Here's the configuration:  Frontend reverse caching proxy server running httpd 2.2.2, prefork mpm.  The backend web server is httpd 1.3.36 with mod_jk 1.2.15.  Mod_jk connects to Tomcat 5.0.30 via an ajp 1.3 connector. The namespace /res/* is mounted into Tomcat via mod_jk's JKMount directive.  The first time content is accessed via the front end proxy, it sends the approperate content-type header, e.g. 'image/jpeg'.  Further attempts to get the same image usually return a content-type header of 'text/html'.  Here's the correct headers from the client and server:  GET /res/img/content/liferaft.jpg HTTP/1.1 Host: nuked.greatschools.net User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3 Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Cookie: TRNO=1127250133.198.144.205.133; NumAd=-1; s_vi=[CS]v1|43F0FFA7000062EC-A160B0300000792[CE]; fcP=C=133&T=1137020088512&V=1137020102487; NXCLICK2=011FHWHwNX_mailing/gn/2006_02/ca/8951!y!01!4qcu!52qf!02!4qcv!52qhNX_mailing/gn/2006_02_21/ca/8427!y!01!4r4q!53Uk!02!4r4r!53UqNX_mailing/mss/2006_03/ca/8438.76346803398!y!02!4rJ8!53pF; RMFD=011FiFmA; RMID=c690cd854329f1d0; T3CK=TANT%3D1%7CTANO%3D0; s_cc=true; s_sq=%5B%5BB%5D%5D; JSESSIONID=8870E2C3BE344A492CCC1DCCDE4036AC; PATHWAY=3 Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache  HTTP/1.x 200 OK Date: Tue, 23 May 2006 20:22:31 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.33 (Unix) mod_perl/1.29 mod_ssl/2.8.22 OpenSSL/0.9.7d mod_jk/1.2.15 Etag: W/'26797-1148335021000' Content-Length: 26797 Expires: Wed, 24 May 2006 00:22:31 GMT Content-Type: image/jpeg Last-Modified: Mon, 22 May 2006 21:57:01 GMT Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=99 Connection: Keep-Alive  The next time the image is requested, the server returns the context-type as 'text/html', which causes the browser to try to render the image as if it where html.

I was tinkering with this issue a bit more today and discovered that I could hit the cached image that was origionally served via mod_jk using wget all I want, and it would always return image/jpeg as the content-type.  Once I loaded up firefox and hit ctrl+F5 (force refresh) mod_cache started to return text/html as the content type.  So for some reason, the act of force refreshing in firefox seems to be a trigger.  You are correct that this has something to do with doing a refresh in Firefox. Requesting a refresh in Firefox requires the cache to revalidate the cached entity on the back end server. Something seems to go wrong during this process. Currently I cannot decide if this is because something is wrong in the cache code or because the backend delivers a bad response. So it would be most helpful if you could sniff the network traffic between your proxy httpd and your backend httpd, do a non working refresh request with Firefox and attach the results of your sniffing to this report. Thank you for the followup.  Here's some investigation with tcpdump and ethereal from the proxy server.

I just ran some tcpdump sniffing while pulling an image served directly by httpd on the backend, not going through mod_jk.  It does not set the conent-type header when it returns a 304 http status code.  Here are the headers from the proxy -> backend conversation:  GET /images/reportcard.jpg HTTP/1.1 Host: nuked.greatschools.net User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3 Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Cookie: TRNO=1127250133.198.144.205.133; NXCLICK2=011FHWHwNX_mailing/gn/2006_02/ca/8951!y!01!4qcu!52qf!02!4qcv!52qhNX_mailing/gn/2006_02_21/ca/8427!y!01!4r4q!53Uk!02!4r4r!53UqNX_mailing/mss/2006_03/ca/8438.76346803398!y!02!4rJ8!53pF; RMFD=011Fiz3b; NumAd=-1; RMID=c690cd854329f1d0; s_vi=[CS]v1|43F0FFA7000062EC-A160B0300000792[CE]; T3CK=TANT%3D1%7CTANO%3D0; fcP=C=133&T=1137020088512&V=1137020102487 Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache If-None-Match: '1fae43-4487-3f4e92c4' If-Modified-Since: Thu, 28 Aug 2003 23:39:48 GMT Max-Forwards: 10 X-Forwarded-For: 198.144.205.133 X-Forwarded-Host: nuked.greatschools.net X-Forwarded-Server: nuked.greatschools.net.

The attached patch should fix your problem. So could you please do the following:  1. Start with clean sources (at least without the debug patch I sent earlier) 2. Apply the patch for 39266 3. Apply the attached patch 4. Compile 5. Test 6. Let me know the results :-). Created an attachment (id=18358) Patch against mod_jk.c (1.3 Version) of mod_jk 1.2.15  Apart from the patch against 2.2.x I am pretty much sure that the behaviour of the backend (sending Content-Length and Content-Type for a 304 response) is not compliant with RFC 2616.   10.3.5 in RFC 2616 states:  The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.  I read this as Content-Length and Content-Type header MUST NOT be sent with 304 responses and the behaviour of httpd 2.2.x and the http connector of Tomcat not doing this seem to support this view. From my limited point of view on httpd 1.3 this should be fixed inside mod_jk. I  think that the attached patch, which is untested due to my lack of an available httpd 1.3, does this without breaking other things. So, if you like you can give the attached patch a try to make your backend RFC 2616 compliant again :-). Hi there.  Thanks for your help on this issue.  The patch modules/cache/cache_storage.c seems to do the trick!  I'll try out the patch to mod_jk too.  I agree, it seems like mod_jk is breaking RFC 2616, I'll try out the patch on the backend web server and make sure it doesn't break anything else.   Committed to trunk as r410370 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=410370&view=rev). FYI I've been running the patch against mod_jk.c for about two weeks now with no ill effects.  Backported to 2.2.x as r425725 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=425725&view=rev). The resolution to this bug breaks a MUST-level requirement of RFC2616. From <http://www.w3.org/ Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.5.3>;  [[[ The end-to-end headers stored in the cache entry are used for the constructed response, except that [...]       - any end-to-end headers provided in the 304 or 206 response MUST         replace the corresponding headers from the cache entry. Unless the cache decides to remove the cache entry, it MUST also replace the end-to-end headers  stored with the cache entry with corresponding headers received in the incoming response, except for  Warning headers as described immediately above. If a header field- name in the incoming response  matches more than one header in the cache entry, all such old headers MUST be replaced.  In other words, the set of end-to-end headers received in the incoming response overrides all  corresponding end-to-end headers stored with the cache entry (except for stored Warning headers with  warn-code 1xx, which are deleted even if not overridden). ]]]  The correct resolution was to fix mod_jk, which the reporter said worked for them.  Please back this patch out. I respectfully disagree here. According to 10.3.5 the response must not / should not contain any entity headers (depending on the validator type). Furthermore 10.3.5 states that this should prevent inconsistencies between the cached entity body and the updated header. Content-type is an entity header and changing the Content-type clearly would create inconsistencies between the cached entity body and the updated header. So we are generous in what we acccept. If you still disagree please continue this discussion on the dev@httpd.apache.org list. 10.3.5 says:   [[[ If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT  include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response  MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies  and updated headers. ]]]  That applies to the responses; it doesn't specify the behaviour of the cache when it receives such  responses.  10.3.5 goes on to say   [[[ If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to  reflect any new field values given in the response. ]]]  However, your reading does make sense. Rather than try and second-guess an apparent inconsistency  in the spec, I'll follow up with the HTTP-WG list. 			Christopher Shumway	Mark Nottingham	Ruediger Pluem

What I draw out of that: you can use mod_cgid or mod_cgi with whatever MPM. And the one you load first gets used.  That opens a new question: Why says the doc '[mod_cgid] is used by default instead of mod_cgi whenever a multi-threaded MPM is selected' when there is no such default?

Try to set  DocumentRoot directive to path with nonexistent drive letter, ex. DocumentRoot g:/somepath  During httpd start (both command line called and as a service) httpd will crash.	Just a footnote that we need to determine if the fault occurs in apr, or as a result of a bad call to apr. I have traced this to line 1176 in server/core.c:      arg = ap_server_root_relative(cmd->pool, arg);  which returns a NULL if a directory does not exist.  When line 1178 in server/core.c is reached, this NULL is passed to ap_is_directory as a parameter:      if (apr_filepath_merge((char**)&conf->ap_document_root, NULL, arg,                            APR_FILEPATH_TRUENAME, cmd->pool) != APR_SUCCESS         || !ap_is_directory(cmd->pool, arg)) {  which causes the crash.

39727	null	RESOLVED		Henrik Nordstrom	1149550980000	1204087752000		Incorrect ETag on gzip:ed content Entities gzip:ed by mod_deflate still carries the same ETag as the plain entiy, causing inconsistency in ETag aware proxy caches.  It is very important each unique entity carries unique ETag:s as these identify the specific entity variant of the URL. Each negotiated variant (where Accept-Encoding is just one negotioantio parameter) needs to have unique ETag:s. For mod_deflate it's as simple as adding the encoding to the already computed ETag.  This has implications on at least the following HTTP directives:     If-None-Match  used in Vary negotiation from ETag aware caches    If-Range       ranges in gzip:ed entity obviously not the same as ranges in the plain entity    If-Match       mainly conditional PUT requests   Example HTTP responses from an Apache-2.2.2 mod_deflate enabled server (irrelevant headers pruned):  Plain request     Server: Apache/2.2.2 (Fedora)    ETag: '76e23-1835-4156af5e53ac0'    Content-Length: 6197    Vary: Accept-Encoding,User-Agent      Same request with 'Accept-Encoding: gzip':     Server: Apache/2.2.2 (Fedora)    ETag: '76e23-1835-4156af5e53ac0'    Vary: Accept-Encoding,User-Agent    Content-Encoding: gzip    Content-Length: 1829    Implications of this:    * Clients may be given the incorrect response. In effect the first cached response is given to all clients as If-None-Match indicates the entitiy is OK for all clients..  (same ETag used in both responses -> Same If-None-Match request so mod_deflate can not tell if the If-None-Match condition is on a compressed or plain entity..)    * Clients doing range requests with If-Range may end up with corrupted objects containing part compressed part plain content.   Squid-2.6 and later is ETag aware and will make this problem quite visible. Release date for Squid-2.6 is 1/7 (i.e. in less than a month).

Sorry for my confusion, but this will only work if mod_deflate is used via mod_filter, right? It will not work if mod_deflate is used without mod_filter.

Agreed, but then we must make the use of mod_filter (or at least the usage of these parts) mandatory or must incorporate them into the core filter routines. From a protocol perspective removing the ETag is sufficient to make you compliant. If conditionals (If-xxx) anyway doesn't work right on transformed responses there is not much benefit of sending an ETag out.  But if you can it's better if you send an ETag. As I said initially you don't need  to compute a new etag, just adding some extra detail to the tag is fine.  I.e. '638f3e-6-1b6d6340-gzip' or similar for a gzip:ed entity where the base entity had the etag '638f3e-6-1b6d6340'.  To HTTP the etag is just a string with the only requirement that it must be unique for each entity variants of the same URL.  Actually I think adding details to the ETag may simplify many things for you as the core routines then can make quick asssssments of conditionals if it's possible to infer information about how the object had been processed from looking at the entity tag. Any progress on getting this patch (or another reasonable alternative) into the mod_deflate tree? (In reply to comment #7) > Any progress on getting this patch (or another reasonable alternative) into the > mod_deflate tree?  It needs raising on dev@ so we can reach a consensus solution.  Bugzilla has only proved that we have  more than one competing solution. This needs to be fixed by mod_deflate producing a new etag.  How we do that is going to take some investigation, since it doesn't do any good to produce the etag unless we can also check it on conditional requests.  My suggestion is to simply extend the existing etag with a gzip marker, for example adding ;gzip at the end or something like that.  I.e. if the original reply had  ETag: '6bf1f7-6-1b6d6340'  Then make mod-gzip translate this to  ETag: '6bf1f7-6-1b6d6340;gzip'  This should allows for easy bidirectional mapping, simplifying most conditionals as no transformation of the entity body is needed to find the etag, and the simple format makes it easier to trace should any misunderstandings occur. Pinging dev@ one more time.. Just committed a fix to make any ETag weak if we transform the entity.  Hopefully this should fix protocol compliance (and our users) without being controversial.  Not sufficient. The two versions is not semantically equivalen as one can not be exchanged for the other without breaking the protocol. In the context of If-None-Match the weak comparator is used in HTTP and there a strong ETag is equal to a weak ETag. Can you elaborate in more detail why you think that the two versions are not semantically equivalent? I read 13.3.3 in a way that they are. Because you can not exchange the gzip:ed variant with the identity encoded variant wihout causing breakage. The two do not mean the same thing to a recipient who do not know how to handle gzip.  The two is only semantically equivalent for a recipient capable of handling gzip, but not to HTTP in general as HTTP do not guarantee clients can handle gzip.  If they were semantically equivalent then there would be no need for conditional mod_gzip compression, or the use of Vary, at least not other than to reduce the load on the server under peak load... What you can do is to either  a) Drop the ETag completely. This is not opimal but works..  b) Or modify the ETag value in some manner. For example adding a constant string infront or after the original ETag.  In 'b', if the compression is not deterministic and always resulting in the same encoding then the ETag should additionally be made weak, to make sure no one attemtps merging partial responses down the line..    The main downside of 'a' is that ETag aware caches will then cache multiple copies of the same object, one per each slight varance of Vary indicated headers. For Apache itself it's not so big difference until conditional requests works proper in precense of filters like mod_deflate (i.e. If-None-Match). (In reply to comment #15) > Because you can not exchange the gzip:ed variant with the identity encoded > variant wihout causing breakage. The two do not mean the same thing to a > recipient who do not know how to handle gzip.  Bugzilla is the wrong place for this discussion.  Should be on dev@httpd.  Only a recipient that can handle gzip will be served the gzipped version.  > The two is only semantically equivalent for a recipient capable of handling > gzip, but not to HTTP in general as HTTP do not guarantee clients can handle gzip.

Huh?  Those exist precisely because we need to cater for different clients. (In reply to comment #17)  > Only a recipient that can handle gzip will be served the gzipped version.  Which isn't true due to this bug. If there is a ETag aware cache between the client and Apache the client will be given whatever the previous client could handle.  > Huh?

So the intermediate has been told that the entity is equivalent but not byte-by-byte identical, and may be subject to negotiated transformation.  Therefore the intermediate is responsible for dealing with content-negotiated properties.  Do you have a particular intermediate in mind, when you propose something that treats a weak ETag as strong? 2.2 r608849 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=608849 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=581198 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=607219			Henrik Nordstrom	Nick Kew	Roy T.

I have not used this before, but so I am not sure here, but the docs for mod_rewrite seem to state that the RE should match on the URL path minus the Location prefix.  So given physical path '/path/to/docs/foo/bar', DocumentRoot 'path/to/docs' and Request 'http://big.com/foo/baz/boo.html'  <Location /foo>   RewriteEngine On   RewriteRule ^baz/(.*) /bar/$1 [R,L] </Location>  The above does not match as per the docs, but instead against '/path/to/docs/foo/baz/boo.html' and fails.  RewriteLog (3) Output: [perdir /foo/] add path info postfix: /path/to/docs/foo/baz -> /path/to/docs/foo/baz/boo.html [perdir /foo/] applying pattern '^baz/(.*)' to uri '/path/to/docs/foo/baz/boo.html'   Here is the complete httpd.conf I used (sanitized):  ### httpd.conf LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so  PidFile /path/to/logs/httpd.pid ErrorLog /path/to/logs/error_log LogLevel Debug RewriteLog '/path/to/logs/rewrite_log' RewriteLogLevel 3  Listen 80 ServerName localhost DocumentRoot '/path/to/docs'  <Location /foo>   RewriteEngine On   RewriteRule ^baz/(.*) /bar/$1 [R,L] </Location>	heh, and before I get corrected on this, I meant to type:   RewriteRule ^baz/(.*) bar/$1 [R,L] not    RewriteRule ^baz/(.*) /bar/$1 [R,L]  so that it redirects from /foo/baz to /foo/bar.  But, that does not really matter for the issue at hand. Where do you see docs implying the prefix will be stripped?  In general, using mod_rewrite directives inside <Location> is almost never necessary and can produce unpredictable results.  It should probably just be documented as unsupported. I agree, not that useful really.  But it *is* documented to work in mod_rewrite docs.  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule  Along with many examples at the end of RewriteRule section, there is also a note stating:  'Note: Pattern matching in per-directory context  Never forget that Pattern is applied to a complete URL in per-server configuration files. However, in per-directory configuration files, the per-directory prefix (which always is the same for a specific directory) is automatically removed for the pattern matching and automatically added after the substitution has been done. This feature is essential for many sorts of rewriting - without this, you would always have to match the parent directory, which is not always possible.  There is one exception: If a substitution string starts with ""http://'', then the directory prefix will not be added ,and an external redirect (or proxy throughput, if using flag P) is forced!'    Aslo note that that note states *one* exception, but the examples show that it is only added back if there is no leading '/'.  So, the exception is actually the rule in most cases. There's your confusion: When the docs refer to per-directory configuration, they mean <Directory> sections and .htaccess files, not <Location> sections.  Unless someone can see a good reason for using RewriteRule in <Location>, I'll change this to a doc bug and suggest just noting that it is unsupported. I've now clarified this somewhat in the docs.

These rules are inside a <Directory /var/www/html/db> section, if that helps. Yes. That was obvious from the description and the rewrite log. ;-)  The [L] flag works as expected (finishing the Ruleset). What you probably didn't expect was that the internal redirect finds the whole ruleset again and again. That's a different issue and a side effect of RewriteRules in the directory context.  -> invalid. Well, as my teacher used to say, it's either a bug in the program or a bug in the documentation.  This behaviour isn't documented; who do I send requests like this to?  Thanks! If someone updates the RewriteEngine documentation, some of the points from http://www.sitepoint.com/print/mod_rewrite-no-endless-loops would be good to include. It's kinda documented, but too implicit and so quite bad. The place for such requests is here ;) You can also place patches here or enter the docs list (http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/) :-) I'd love to supply a patch, but I don't know enough about what's going on to write one for this.  I'd be supplying some 'G' for the GIGO process. The new rewrite flags documentation (httpd.apache.org/docs/rewrite/flags.html) will be providing more detail on things like this. I'll be certain to cover this particular annoyance there. Thanks for the reminder. The more I think about it, the more I think this is a misfeature.  If '[L]' doesn't stop further rewriting (in directory rules), then it doesn't serve a purpose (in directory rules).  Is there a workaround? (In reply to comment #8) > The more I think about it, the more I think this is a misfeature.  If '[L]' > doesn't stop further rewriting (in directory rules), then it doesn't serve a > purpose (in directory rules).  Well, as  Andr?? said, it stops processing in that round of processing. The internal redirect is nearly a new request (well, not everything is being re-processed). The L-Flag is usefull in per-dir context, just think about 20 rules and the first did match. With out the L-flag everything below would be tested in that round of processing, too. That saves processing.

40030	null	RESOLVED		Darryl Miles	1152730020000	1156266364000		) The documentaiton page at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_dav.html  Has:  <LimitExcept GET OPTIONS>   require user admin </LimitExcept>   This example does not seem the best general purpose case since it omits the HEAD and POST options, which would allow to standard URL access to occur but correctly limit methods employed by DAV.  <LimitExcept GET HEAD OPTIONS POST>   require user admin </LimitExcept>	As the <Limit> directive doc says, HEAD is implied by GET.  I'm neutral about POST.  Being more restrictive in the examples is usually better than less restrictive. If I may clarify my thoughts.  Someone adding DAV to their website wants to restricts the additional DAV operations but retain the existing web-application operations, so their web-application continues to work like it did before.  If they wanted to restrict the POST operation they would already have configured a rule for that outside of the additional configuration required for DAV.   Are you saying that DAV utilizes the POST method for any operation and in doing so that optation may modify data or expose extra data to an anonymous website user; that the anonymous website user wouldn't be able to have done otherwise.  So summarize that question 'Can a privilege escalation via the POST method occur for an anonymous website user ?'  When I audited the example configuration changes myself by researching into the commands I was adding this exact concern immediatly came to mind.  After 5 mins looking over the code for what DAV does via the POST method I could not see any active component.  I'm trying to spare someone else less technical than me this headache that the suggestion of <LimitExcept GET OPTIONS> implies, in that DAV maybe unsafe for any website utilizing the POST method for its everyday operations so we dont recommend <LimitExcept GET OPTIONS POST>.   Point taken on the HEAD issue but again <LimitExcept GET HEAD OPTIONS POST> is much clearer to understand than <LimitExcept GET OPTIONS POST>, it means I dont have the headache of finding out why HEAD wasn't included.  If they are equal and one way is clearer than the other, use the clearer way in the documentation.  Is your neurtal stance due to being unsure of the effects of DAV+POST ?  Maybe a DAV guru will notice this and contribute their wizdom.  I'm now thinking if there are side effects these should be documented.  Either way I'm just trying to remove the concern that a potential user may get after reading the current documentation.  I don't have any objection to adding POST.  In general, people should only open up the methods they use, which frequently will not include POST.  But I agree with you that in the context of DAV, it may make sense to address the methods that are not affected by 'Dav On'.  I would certainly object to adding HEAD.  It would lead to people thinking they could restrict HEAD and GET independently, resulting in more confusion, not less.   In fact, the server should probably issue a warning if HEAD is present in a <Limit(except)>.  Understood your objections noted.  How abouts adding a comment line above the LimitExcept clause:  ... # HEAD not required explicitly, GET implies HEAD <LimitExcept GET OPTIONS POST> ...  That would make things very clear and keep us both happy. I've added POST to the trunk version of the docs.  It is unlikely to get backported, so it won't be seen in a release for a while.  Thanks for your suggestion.			Darryl Miles	Joshua Slive
40046	null	RESOLVED		Ian Abel	1152886800000	1185885903000		mod_rewrite PT (Pass Through) option has L side effect a rule with the PT option behaves like a rule with the L option. This is either  a bug in the behaviour or a bug in the documentation given it is only clear  that this occurs by reading the source.	And how does your RewriteRule with the corresponding RewriteLog with loglevel 5 look like? This is not determined from any rewrite rule that i can post but from this code  snippet from the latest release of apache 2.2.2.  httpd-2.2.2/modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c , line 3939 and following             if (p->flags & RULEFLAG_PASSTHROUGH) {                 rewritelog((r, 2, perdir, 'forcing '%s' to get passed through '                            'to next API URI-to-filename handler', r->filename));                 r->filename = apr_pstrcat(r->pool, 'passthrough:',                                          r->filename, NULL);                 changed = ACTION_NORMAL;                 break;             }  The break statement causes the loop over rewrite rules to be exited from. A  rewrite rule that exhibits this behaviour is for example:  RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING}  !moose=1 RewriteRule /(.*) /$1?moose=0 [PT,QSA]  RewriteRule /(.*) /$1 [E=TEST:1]  Which doesn't result in TEST being set if moose=1 is not present in the query  string. This is non-documented non-obvious behaviour. (Yes there are many other  ways of rewriting the rules to avoid this, if you consider this behaviour to be  correct / to spec, please document it). I think the behaviour is correct, but of course this should be documented. So I change the component to Documentation. This behavior bit me, too. Working around it resulted in a somewhat ugly solution. Perhaps add an option that disables the current [L]-like behavior. And obviously, this needs to be documented. The fact that PT implies L has been documented on trunk.			Bob Ionescu	Ian Abel	Joshua Slive	Ruediger Pluem	Samuli K

If I reverse the order of the AuthnProviderAlias declarations and put padl before ldap, the problem goes away.  If I pick different aliases, I have to guess at the right order to do this.	By the way, this bug has been reproduced on both Windows and Linux, though we didn't manage to capture the stack on Windows. Isn't the problem that you have the provider alias being aliased to itself?  You can't do that: pick another name for the first alias besides 'ldap'.  The code may technically permit it, but I expect that's the root cause as they share the same provider namespace and if you get into a recursive definition, funny things may happen. Ahh. I guess the documentation for mod_auth_alias wasn't very clear as to what the baseProvider and aliasName were referring to.  This makes sense.  Seems rather ugly that such a misconfiguration could cause apache to go into an endless loop.  But, at least now we know how to make this do the right thing. Thanks.

40064	null	RESOLVED		Ross Heritage	1153220220000	1173687352000		Problem with ETags between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. The last modified date stored in r->mtime is of type apr_int64_t.   When this is used to build up the ETag in modules/http/http_protocol.c (in  ap_make_etag), this variable is cast to an unsigned long prior to the  converion to hex.  next = etag_ulong_to_hex(next, (unsigned long)r->mtime);  On a 32-bit architecture, this loses the first 32-bits of the number, so the  resulting hex string is only 8 characters long, and does not accuratly reflect  the last-modified time.  On a 64-bit architecture, the cast retains all 64 bits (or more likely its  casting a 128-bit number down to 64-bits), so the resulting hex value is  correct.  This is a big problem for us at the BBC as we now have a mixture of 32-bit and  64-bit machines (AMD Opteron vs. Intel Xeon).  The problem also seems to exist in the latest Apache 2.2 build, although the  ETag code has been extracted to the file modules/http/http_etag.c  Suggested fix:  Change the etag_ulong_to_hex function so that it only ever pushes the last 8  hex characters on to *next. This is not ideal, as the resulting hex is not  representative of the last-modified date, but I would be surprised if this  were to bite anyone.	Changing etag_ulong_to_hex() to use an apr_uint64_t and dropping the casts would be a better fix, I think. Either way, I've ran into this myself before.  Don't suppose anyone wants to write a patch :) ? Created an attachment (id=18635) patch to use apr_uint64_t for etags  Here's a quick patch to always use 64-bit integers in etag generation.\tTested only to compile and produce etags on x86_64, not tried a 32-bit platform or anything more thorough. *** Bug 41095 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Committed: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=517238 - thanks for the report.  I'm not sure whether it would be a good idea to merge this into 2.2.x; it could break working 32-bit-only shops by having different 2.2.x releases generate different etags across a server farm.

Could an option to disable this be added to the installer? And even better, could that option be disabled by default?	shortcuts can be trivially deleted, and when you give someone the option to 'exit' the taskbar app, they need a way to get back in. > they need a way to get back in.  Yes, but there's no reason for that shortcut to be in the startup group. A regular shortcut would work fine for that. Now we're talking, you suggest promoting into the regular Apache shortcut group, instead of nesting in the control subgroup, right?  I'll tweak that for 2.2.7, thanks for the suggestion.  Actually I had trouble finding it burried in there when I fixed it (the shortcut had been broken for a release or two). No, I mean the Instance Manager, that sits in the tray. A shortcut for it used to be installed in the Startup dir of the start menu, such that it got started automatically after each login. However, I just did a fresh install of 2.2.6 and can't find any shortcut to the instance manager. 'I just did a fresh install of 2.2.6 and can't find any shortcut to the instance manager.'  Those are called taskbar icon applications, and the shortcut to it was broken in 2.2.6 and sometime earlier (I mentioned it was broken).  I've restored it, and placed it under the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.7 shortcut group instead of burring it under Apache HTTP Server 2.2.7 -> Control Services.  > Those are called taskbar icon applications,  AFAIK the icons are in the (system) tray.  > I've restored it, and placed it under the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.7 shortcut group instead of burring it under Apache HTTP Server 2.2.7 -> Control Services.  Does that mean it doesn't start automatically anymore? Ok - so to clarify, all the shortcuts were broken, you would see the apachemonitor upon installation, and never after.  I totally agree that such can be annoying.  This is why the startup group  is chosen over the HKxx/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run, which is much more insidious.  It will again create these shortcuts.  However, it is not a 'key' resource. If you remove this shortcut, the installer should not believe the package has been broken.  Since this is certainly not a common request, but a very minority opinion, we'll leave things be.  Decided you are right in that the ApacheMonitor is a seperate element of the package...  custom install will let you optionally omit this in 2.2.7 - entirely (none of the shortcuts that bothered you, and no ApacheMonitor.exe either). Thanks. Still wondering though, what's the advantage of Apache Monitor compared to the standard Windows Services interface? Very little difference if you are conversant with the SCM (service control manager), although it lets you watch multiple machines at once.  Because some users are 'starting out', it's a handy tool (I use it often to manage some 15 test installations of various flavors of httpd in development.)  I sort of disagree with it's 'coloring scheme' (I think one dead 'automatic' service is too many, while a dead 'manual' service is never bad), and it's just a little slow on the uptake about reporting services in transition (it won't tell you as clearly about starting/stopping).  In full-view mode it provides some extra context about problems starting the service, which is handy.  I should finally point out that with this change, it's actually possible to install /only/ the ApacheMonitor (although why someone needs to do this is sort of beyond me ;-)			Olaf van der Spek	Will Rowe

We will use .ecma instead. (In reply to comment #3) > The extension .es conflicts with existing language extension for Spanish. > We will use .ecma instead.  The extension .pl for perl files also conflicts with existing file extension for polish, .pl. Other existing conflicts may exist. We deal with such conflicts since years...  My question is: why does this conflict seem to be a problem *now*, but the other existing conflicts (e.g. .pl file extension vs. polish language extension) don't? Why using .ecma instead of the RFC-proposed .es and leave the other conflicts untouched?  Is there a possibility to let check apache, if the last file extension is one for content negotiation or the 'normal' file extension? If such a possibility theoretically exists or could exist, I propose, it should be implemented into apache to avoid such conflict situations in the future. What's your opinion about that issue?   Reopened this bug to get an answer to comment #4. You ask why new conflicts are problems but not existing ones.  The other conflicts are problems too. But when you have a conflict you need to make a decision about which type wins. Absent a very compelling argument otherwise, it is clear that an existing type/language should win out over a new one to prevent breaking sites that rely on the existing extension.  A very compelling argument would be, for example, concrete evidence showing that .es is very-widely used for your type and almost never used for the language.			Dave Hodder	Joshua Slive	Roy T.

40310	null	RESOLVED		Ian Abel	1156436100000	1187356078000		Ajp Connection handling causes unexpected results. With an apahce proxying requests over ajp to a backend tomcat, the following  sequence of events is possible:  User1 requests /badger, and sends headers. Request hits apache, filters into ap_proxy_ajp_request in mod_proxy_ajp.c User1 terminates connection with extreme prejudice. Apache sends headers to tomcat. Tomcat takes it's time. Apache tries to read the rest of the request body with ap_get_brigade,  mod_proxy_ajp.c:174. This fails as the underlying socket cannot recv any more. So ap_proxy_ajp_request returns 500 immediatly. conn->close++ is not called so  the connection is not touched, merely put back in the available connections. Apache now fails int he output filters trying to send the status 500 error  message.  Now user2 connects, requests /moose, apache takes the above connection from the  pool and sends the headers down the pipe to the tomcat. The tomcat now returns /badger, as that's finally finished processing.  Apache in ajp_read_header reads the SEND_BODY_CHUNK message, and processes it.  Then repeats reading messages until the END_RESPONSE message.  Whereupon apache has successfully served /badger to someone who requested / moose.   Needless to say this is a critical flaw with the ajp connection handling.

40432	null	RESOLVED		Egmont Koblinger	1157629380000	1185886162000		Charset of date on error pages The error text (e.g. 'Objekt nicht gefunden' and its longer explanation) is  presented in the language the client requests. Its character set is defined for  every language by the error templates Apache provides.  However, in the footer, the date is shown in the language and charset  corresponding to the locale on the server side, with no character set  conversion.  As a result, if these two character sets do not match, the date will be shown  with wrong accented characters.  For example, suppose Apache runs with LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8 and the client  requests French language. The header of the returned page will define the ISO- 8859-1 charset (taken from the error templates), but the date will be put there  with UTF-8, hence it appears as 'double UTF-8'. Stranger results (even invalid  byte sequences) can occur with other combination of the two languages (e.g. the  server may run with hu_HU while the client requests Japanese...)  Suggested solutions:  - [I'd prefer this one] Convert all error templates to UTF-8, and modify Apache  to convert the date string received from libc (strftime() I guess) from the  current locale to UTF-8.  or  - Modify Apache to convert the date string received from libc from the current  locale to &#num; html entities so that they work with any character set. [I  hate html entities anyway and I see no reason not to use bare UTF-8.]	For both this and bug 40431 the problem is basically the same: the locale is a process-global setting which cannot be changed per-request, and changing it to match an Accept-Language/Charset-supplied values would probably be a nightmare anyway.  I think the right fix for this is to simply remove the date from the error pages.  It's not particularly useful and this complaint is not unreasonable.  [in glibc there are locale-specific interfaces which can use non-global locale context but being able to use these in httpd would be nearly impossible without designing a set of essentially glibc-specific interfaces] *** Bug 40431 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Well, instead of removing the date, you could perhaps format it using numbers  only (e.g. 2006/09/07 14:15 +0200) or format in English using a built-in table  of English month and weekday names (hence not using libc's localized names).  I know about this newlocale()/uselocale()/*_l() stuff, but that's really glibc- specific and requires a quite recent glibc, too. So it'd really be a bad  approach for apache. I didn't realize when submitting the bug that apache is a  multi-thread app so using setlocale() around strftime() isn't safe.  The date has been removed from the error pages.

On Apache 2.0.54, the HTTP return status is 200 OK but the access log also recorded - as return status code.  (I do the debug on 2.2.3 src) This seems to be because of the return value of ap_scan_script_header_err_core and ap_scan_script_header_err_strs functions (in server/util_script.c) or incorrectly replace HTTP response status code in send_response_header (arch/win32/mod_isapi.c).  server/util_script.c ap_scan_script_header_err_core -> the function does look for Status in the headers and set the r->status if it exist. The function then return OK (which is define as 0). Shouldn't this function return HTTP_OK if status is not define in the header or the status that is provided in the header?  ap_scan_script_header_err_strs -> return the result from ap_scan_script_header_err_core  arch/win32/mod_isapi.c send_response_header -> Call ap_scan_script_header_err_strs then assign the return value to cid->r->status.  From line 712     if (stat) {         cid->r->status = ap_scan_script_header_err_strs(cid->r, NULL,                                         &termch, &termarg, stat, head, NULL);         cid->ecb->dwHttpStatusCode = cid->r->status;     }     else {         cid->r->status = ap_scan_script_header_err_strs(cid->r, NULL,                                         &termch, &termarg, head, NULL);   .....  In both case cid->r->status get set to 0 (with valid header) when it should be 200 (HTTP_OK) or other status which may be set from ap_scan_script_header_err_core.  I call ServerSupportFunction by: 1) strTemp.Format('Content-Type: text/html/r/nContent-Length: %d/r/n/r/n', strResult.GetLength()); dw = strTemp.GetLength(); pECB->ServerSupportFunction( pECB->ConnID, HSE_REQ_SEND_RESPONSE_HEADER, \t\t\t\tNULL,  \t\t\t\t&dw,  \t\t\t\t(DWORD *)(LPCTSTR) strTemp) 2) strTemp.Format('Content-Type: text/html/r/nContent-Length: %d/r/n/r/n', strResult.GetLength()); dw = strTemp.GetLength(); pECB->ServerSupportFunction( pECB->ConnID, HSE_REQ_SEND_RESPONSE_HEADER, \t\t\t\t'200 OK',  \t\t\t\t&dw,  \t\t\t\t(DWORD *)(LPCTSTR) strTemp) 3) With HSE_REQ_SEND_RESPONSE_HEADER_EX putting the same info in HSE_URL_MAPEX_INFO  for the second param.

In my test with Apache 2.2.3, now I get status log as 1 on the access log, and get real Internal Error from apache. I test with HSE_REQ_SEND_RESPONSE_HEADER case and get ate == headlen (Is that suppose to be the normal correct case?)  Thanks, TP Good catch, thank you.

40476	null	RESOLVED		Amichai	1158014100000	1161674275000		warn message is mistakenly written to access log In the server's access log, there is one line that is not an access record that shows up a few times:  [Thu Sep 07 03:09:06 2006] [warn] pid file C:/XXX/logs/httpd.pid overwritten -- Unclean shutdown of previous Apache run?  it looks like it's being written to the wrong log file - it should be in the error log along with the other warnings and errors, not the access log.	Oops... this happens in version 2.2.3, which is missing from the dropdown menu... dunno if it's in 2.3 HEAD as well. Created an attachment (id=18888) ap_open_logs does not store new stderr -   ap_open_logs in server/log.c does not store the new stderr in the static variable stderr_log.  The old handle is closed, or might even be re-used for a different file (which is probably what happened to this guy). I don't really follow that patch: stderr_log is a global variable which is initialized once at startup.  It doesn't really matter *which* apr_file_t * that dup2 happens against; fd 2 ends up the same anyway.   Do you have a repro case for this, Tom? Is it possible that stderr is not fd 2 on Windows? During my investigations for PR40651 I saw a comment in the APR documentation about this (http://apr.apache.org/docs/apr/group__apr__file__io.html#ga10). So this maybe a Windows specific problem. For Unix systems I agree with your analysis. as u probably discerened from my original post, this indeed occured on a Windows (XP) system. If there's some test u'd like me to run to recreate/diagnose this, I'd be glad to help.  There is no 'fd' vis-a-vis unix.  Handles are arbitrarilly assigned.  It absolutely must be applied for non-pure-posix portability. This looks like a good solution but I don't have a platform to apply to at this instant. Yes, the problem happens on Windows.  The stderr filehandle is not 2, as in Unix, and a dup() of stderr produces a new (arbitrary) filehandle value.  For a quick repro: If you start Apache 2.2.3 on Windows with a pre-existing httpd.pid - no 'Unclean shutdown' message appears in the error log (the write is attempted to a closed filehandle).  If you repeat this after applying the patch, the message correctly appears in the error log.  I cannot repro the case where the message appears in the wrong file.  It is just conjecture that a previously closed stderr handle got re-used for an access log in Amichai's installation. Well it seems like an obviously-correct cleanup anyway, so be it:  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=467338 Note this was surplanted by a new two-pool approach, maintaining the old stderr log pool during the creation of the new stderr log pool, then on success tearing down the old one.  That solution required significant refactoring in apr, lest Tom's issue pop up, all over again.			Amichai	Joe Orton	Ruediger Pluem	Tom Donovan	Will Rowe

40651	null	RESOLVED		Rainer Jung	1159706940000	1165584003000		Orphaned piped logger process after graceful restart I use Apache 2.2.3 on Solaris. All Logfiles are configured to use rotatelogs. Whenever I restart Apache either with 'restart' or with 'graceful' The first piped logger, which cares about the global error log, is left over in the process table. To be more precise: For all loggers new processes get started, and all apart from the described old one terminate. The problem is this unnecessary old process that doesn't die.  One description of a reason is, that Apache 2.2 uses APR to do the fork and APR uses '/bin/sh -c' to do that. Unfortunately /bin/sh on Solaris doesn an additional fork when called with '-c' and we end up with a process tree of depth three: Apache-/bin/sh-rotatelogs. It looks like the termination mechanism and the signal handling of Apache is not made for this situation.  I described a related problem in Bugzilla   http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=38989  I didn't really trace the signal problem down to the details for Apache 2.2/APR but again the same solution does work: If I use another Shell in SHELL_PATH, which does not fork for '-c', the problem goes away.  Changing the SHELL_PATH in apr_arch_threadproc.h from '/bin/sh' to '/usr/xpg4/bin/sh' worked. That's a XPG4 compliant shell which exists on Solaris since Solaris 2.5, so for about 10 years.  The shell is similar to ksh (see 'man ksh') and does *not* fork when called with '-c'.  It would be nice to at least document the behaviour. Really nice would be to make SHELL_PATH changeable via configure and to be able to change it via Apaches configure (and if that would be documented).  If it's really necessary, I could pin down, why the problem only applies for the first error logger. On the other hand, I also would like to get rid of the additional /bin/sh processes, so using another shell would solve both problems.	(In reply to comment #0) > I use Apache 2.2.3 on Solaris.

I could try with Solaris 8 and 10 to, but that would have to wait until tuesday.  5. Could you please truss /bin/sh -c and logrotate during the restart with    options -faedl -vall -rall -wall?  Yes, I'll attach them in a minute. I didn't do the 'rall', because I don't want the whole config to be in the truss. I'm confident, that the reads are not that important. Otherwise I need to redo the thing with a test configuration.  Also I'll attach three ps excerpts, one directly after start, the second after graceful and the third after restart. The processes I'm talking about are:  ps1.out:    root 11820 11818  0 22:58:45 ?        0:00 /bin/sh -c /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 8 ps1.out:    root 11822 11820  0 22:58:45 ?        0:00 /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 86400  !ps2.out:    root 11822     1  0 22:58:45 ?        0:00 /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 86400 ps2.out:    root 11926 11818  0 22:59:32 ?        0:00 /bin/sh -c /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 8 ps2.out:    root 11929 11926  0 22:59:32 ?        0:00 /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 86400  !ps3.out:    root 11822     1  0 22:58:45 ?        0:00 /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 86400 !ps3.out:    root 11929     1  0 22:59:32 ?        0:00 /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 86400 ps3.out:    root 12034 11818  0 23:00:04 ?        0:00 /bin/sh -c /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 8 ps3.out:    root 12037 12034  0 23:00:04 ?        0:00 /usr/local/apache22/bin/rotatelogs /var/apache/logs/error_log_main 86400   Created an attachment (id=18944) gzipped truss  Created an attachment (id=18945) Process table after start  Created an attachment (id=18946) Process table after apachectl graceful  Created an attachment (id=18947) Process table after apachectl restart  Hi Rainer,  many thanks for the quick feedback. I think I know why this problem only happens to the main error logrotater:  httpd closes the writing side of the pipe to the logrotater. This auses the logrotater to exit and thus /bin/sh -c to exit. There is no need to send a SIGTERM to either /bin/sh -c or logrotate in this case. This does not work this way with the main error logrotater since the writing side fd has been previously copied (dup2ed) to stderr. After a start of the new main error log logrotater its wrting side should be dup2ed again to stderr. This should cause the old stderr file descriptor to be closed and thus causing the logrotator to exit as this is the last open writing side of the pipe. This does not seem to work on Solaris (libc on Solaris seems to do a fcntl(13, F_DUP2FD, 0x00000002) instead of dup2(13,2)). I did not have the time to do further tests on this issue. As you may notice the logrotater dies after the main httpd process has died as the OS does now seem to close the file descriptor correctly.  Since I personally do not use logrotation on the main error log file for years (and this works perfectly if you do everything else in virtual hosts and nothing in the main server) I am not quite sure anymore, but I think I stopped logrotating the main error log file because log messages did not arrive there during restart / graceful restart.  Nevertheless it makes still sense to me to stop hardcoding /bin/sh in APR. Additionally to be able to set SHELL_PATH via configure it might be even better if you can set the shell path via some APR function and APR only uses SHELL_PATH if nothing was set. Hi R??diger,  I'm impressed! I had a look at the truss output to, but got stuck exactly around the dup2 fcntl.  You comments about main error logger are interesting. In fact it would be better not to pipe that one to be sure, that errors can be written at any time. And usually everything else happens in vhosts, so not rotating that one is not a huge problem.  But nevertheless, freeing up half of the log child processes by using another shell to invoke still would be nice. The process table looks a lot cleaner after dropping the '/bin/sh -c' processes.  I'm not very experienced with the auto(conf|make|header) stuff, although I did some changes to the configure process in mod_jk. If time permits, I could have a look at it for APR next sunday, but if you or anyone else knows easily how to include this feature I would be happy.  Created an attachment (id=18949) Small test program for dup2  Attached a small quick and dirty test program. If dup2 really does not work on Solaris it should print out:   Child: Hello World!  and NOT return to shell. If it returns to the shell dup2 works as expected. On my Solaris 9 testbox dup2 seems to work as expected. Odd!  If it turns out not to be a Solaris bug with dup2, can you please do the following:  1. Do a truss again as previously (-vall -wall -faedl). 2. Do a graceful restart. 3. Issue pfiles <pid of remaining logrotater> 4. Issue pfiles <pid of httpd main process> 5. Attach outputs of pfiles and truss and let me know the pids of the httpd main    process and the remaining logrotater.  This is reproducible on Linux by using, e.g.:  ErrorLog '| true; /path/to/rotatelogs etc'  which forces the sh process to hang around. This is a fun bug!  After the graceful restart, the *new* piped logger for the main error log is running with its fd 2 pointing to the pipe to the *old* piped logger which it is replacing.  That is the only place that fd is left open, and it's what is preventing the old piped logger from exiting.  The use of the 'sh' process is just what is needed to make this problem apparent.  Otherwise the rotatelogs will get SIGTERMed by the parent directly on restart.  (courtesy of piped_log_cleanup)  Created an attachment (id=18950) proof-of-concept fix  This should prevent the orphaned piped loggers, not sure if this is the optimal solution though. Re-assigning this to httpd. (In reply to comment #12) > This is a fun bug!

I am a little worried that nobody reads at the other end of the pipe. What if the logger writes a huge amount of data to its stderr? Wouldn't it get blocked? What about using the stdout of the main process (should be /dev/null) for the logger? I modified your patch to do this. A quick test shows that it works. Comments welcome.    Created an attachment (id=18952) Adjust proof-of-concept fix to use stdout of main process  Hi Rainer,  as your specific problem has to be fixed inside of httpd I propose that you open a new report for the enhancement of APR's configure to make SHELL_PATH configurable. This raises a deeper question though.  Should a graceful restart even recycle the logger processes in httpd?  Or should they be persistent and continue to run (short circuit the open logs to keep the existing files *and processes* around?)     Created an attachment (id=18954) Updated version of the stdout version of the fix, which fixes a fd leak  Thanks Ruediger, that's definitely a better approach.  I've tweaked that, and also realised that this needs to be done *only* for the logger for the main server.  Piped loggers for vhosts should continue to inherit stderr from the main server as before.

Piped loggers for vhosts should continue to  inherit > stderr from the main server as before.  Just for my clarification: This works because the error log of the main server is the first logger that gets 'restarted' during a graceful / restart, right? So the other loggers inherit a stderr that is the writing side of the pipe to the *restarted* main server error logger, correct? Yes, exactly correct. ap_open_logs handles it: opens the main server log, does the dup2-to-stderr trick, then loops through all the vhosts and opens their logs.  (In reply to comment #23) > Yes, exactly correct. ap_open_logs handles it: opens the main server log, does > the dup2-to-stderr trick, then loops through all the vhosts and opens their logs.   Thanks for clarification. Proposed for backport to 2.2.x as r452457 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=452457). The error log still spawns the process using   rc = apr_procattr_cmdtype_set(procattr,                                         APR_SHELLCMD_ENV)) == APR_SUCCESS)  instead of   rc = apr_procattr_cmdtype_set(procattr,                                         APR_PROGRAM_ENV)) == APR_SUCCESS)  as documented http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16761  Typically this is an issue with Windows env .

40653	null	RESOLVED		Larry Stefani	1159771080000	1168397561000		apxs dependency on httpd breaks cross-compilation of other packages With proper environment variables, --host= and --target options, Apache 2.2.3  can be cross-compiled successfully.  However, the bin/apxs PERL script has an  implicit dependency on bin/httpd, which causes a problem when building other  modules.  For example, when adding PHP 5.1.6 to Apache 2.2.3, the --with-apxs2= option  is used on the PHP configure line to point to apxs.  PHP needs to run apxs to  determine the include paths, CFLAGS, etc. used to build Apache.  This fails on  a cross-compiled environment when apxs tries to execute httpd on the host  system.  apxs should become truly platform-independent and not rely on binaries that  cannot be run on the build system.	More information.  PHP developers consider this issue a problem with apxs.  From http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38997&edit=2      [2 Oct 3:19pm UTC] tony2001@php.net      If you want apxs utility to be enhanced - please report it as a feature     request to Apache developers.     There is nothing PHP can do about it.  Feel free to contribute an alternative build tool.  You'll have to deal with  the dependencies too, of course.  And bear in mind that apxs is designed to  work in packages, where you don't have all the build debris lying around.  Anyway, cross-compiling PHP sounds to me like a *much* bigger job than this. >>Feel free to contribute an alternative build tool.  You'll have to deal with  >>the dependencies too, of course.  And bear in mind that apxs is designed to  >>work in packages, where you don't have all the build debris lying around.  That may explain the need to run httpd from apxs.  It appeared that since apxs  is created dynamically, it could at least contain all of the CFLAGS, include  paths, etc. that would be required by a fairly popular external module (PHP),  without reading other files.  >>Anyway, cross-compiling PHP sounds to me like a *much* bigger job than this.  I'm not so sure.  PHP configure supports the same --host= and --target=  options as Apache configure.  I was able to configure and cross-compile PHP  successfully, that is, until I added the --with-apxs2= option.  I didn't  realize that without it, the loadable module that Apache needs isn't built.  Now I'm left with a cross-compiled httpd daemon that loads and runs just fine  on my target platform, but with no PHP support.  I appreciate the feedback.  I'll probably need to revert to installing the GCC  toolchain and software packages on my target platform and rerun the  configure/make steps in 'native' mode.  I was hoping for any workaround that  would allow me to avoid that.  Just wanted to note a workaround for this problem.  By editing the PHP  configure script to replace appropriate $APXS -q calls with explicit  directories and filenames, I was able to avoid executing apxs during the  configure step.  What was necessary was to perform the apxs -q queries on the  target platform (where the apxs can run httpd properly), then take the result  and enter it into the PHP configure script, run configure, then cross-compile  PHP accordingly.  The alternative would be to edit apxs to *not* invoke httpd on simple -q  queries, which can be easily determined when apxs is created.  Created an attachment (id=19384) Fixes apxs for cross-compilation  The attached patch removes the need for apxs to invoke httpd.    With this patch, the value of enable_so is saved into config_vars.mk.  apxs then looks up this value instead of invoking httpd. Great patch David, thanks, that code has annoyed me forever.

40756	null	RESOLVED		Trevin Beattie	1160740680000	1189258315000		Segmentation fault in ap_proxy_checkproxyblock When an Apache config file contains any ProxyBlock directive, if a remote client attempts to proxy through the server (using CONNECT) to a target host which does not have a DNS entry, httpd will segfault.  ap_proxy_connect_handler does a DNS lookup of uri.hostname in proxy_connect.c:127 and stores the result in uri_addr.  However, it does not check for an error until line 174.  On line 144, it calls ap_proxy_checkproxyblock with the uri_addr variable, which can be NULL if the DNS lookup failed.  When ap_proxy_checkproxyblock tries to dereference uri_addr (in proxy_util.c:961 or 965), it accesses invalid memory.  There are a couple of possible solutions to this.  uri_addr is only dereferenced in the call to ap_log_error.  So ap_proxy_checkproxyblock could test uri_addr before calling ap_log_error.  The other solution is to move the check for DNS lookup failure in proxy_connect.c up from line 174 to around 129 (immediately following the call to apr_sockaddr_info_get).	Created an attachment (id=19005) Fix to check the result of apr_sockaddr_info_get before passing uri_addr to ap_proxy_checkproxyblock  Is this ever going to be addressed.  I guess my users like requesting pages that aren't in dns because I'm seeing it all over the place.  But I can only reproduce it with ProxyRemote as well as ProxyBlock.  If I have ProxyRemote off then it works just fine. As soon as I sent that, I realized that I probably sounded snippity.  Totally not intended.  Thank you for the wonderful web server and for all of your hard work.  Dude I'm a dork some times. Reviewing after far too long, it appears your CONNECT patch may still be needed, but the FTP patch appears unnecessary, as the current code makes the check before using the addr.

40878	null	VERIFIED		Rob Baily	1162458480000	1162990117000		For LDAP authentication against Windows Active Directory ldap_simple_bind_s fails after a period This is really more an enhance,ent request then a bug.  Here is the situation:  We set up Apache 2.2.3 on a Linux server and set up Subversion 1.4.0 to be handled by it.  We set up authentication to use LDAP to authenticate users.  We are authenticating to a Windows 2003 server through its LDAP service (using Global Catalog).  Here is the basic configuration.  I mangled some of the entries here as to not expose anything.  <Location />     AuthName 'SVN'     AuthType Basic     AuthBasicProvider file ldap     AuthzLDAPAuthoritative Off     AuthLDAPURL ldap://machinename:3268/dc=Company,dc=com?sAMAccountName?sub     AuthLDAPBindDN 'user@domain.com'     AuthLDAPBindPassword 'xxxxx'     AuthUserFile /var/subversion/conf/svn-auth-users     Require valid-user </Location>  So what happens is that generally it works fine.  But then if a user is inactive for a while (appears to be between 1 and 2 hours) and then tries to perform another operation they get a 500 internal error and a message similar to this is logged in the log file.  [Wed Nov 01 11:50:40 2006] [warn] [client 10.1.2.47] [3994] auth_ldap authenticate: user rbaily authentication failed; URI /svn/projects/candyland/trunk [LDAP: ldap_simple_bind_s() failed][Can't contact LDAP server]  If they attempt to rety the operation then usually between 2 to 5 times it comes back with no problem.  So this was becoming a major headache and causing our developers some pain in getting code checked in or getting updates.  Also it was causing some problems with a continuous build server.  I am not certain about the exact time period or the inactivity but indications pointed to this.  So I looked at the code in modules/ldap/util_ldap.c and changed it slightly.  There is a section of code that attempts to do ldap_simple_bind_s and repeats 10 times if it is getting a LDAP_SERVER_DOWN code.  What I noticed about this is that the connection is not truly being reset everytime.  It basically starts with the current state and tries to bind again.  So I moved out the code that was in the upper part of the uldap_connection_open into a function called uldap_connection_init.  Then in the failures loop if we get halfway (5 tries) then I changed it to unbind and then init it before trying to bind again.  This has worked well for us as we are no longer getting this.  So I realize this may be a Windows only issue and people may not be too keen on corecting it but it seems like it could happen on other types of LDAP servers as well.  I also think the design is a little better having the init stuff put out in a separate function rather than in the open function.  Also I changed some of the other places that had multiple statements for the unbind to call uldap_connection_unbind which handles it.  I think ideally it would be better if we could configure the 10 and 5 numbers through the configuration file but I wasn't really sure how to handle that.  I'll attach a patch to this shortly.	Created an attachment (id=19076) Proposed patch for the enhancement.  Ideally I think the 10 and 5 in the failures loop would be configrable with some defaults like the numbers that are currently used.  However I wasn't really sure about the best way to put that in so I did not do that. Changing severity to enhancement.  Although some people may think it is a bug since it eventually fails the LDAP authentication. Checked into trunk and proposed for backport to 2.2 In our environment we're running Apache 2.2.3 on a Solaris 10 box authenticating against a Windows 2003 LDAP server. This issue also appeared when our developers started porting applications over to Apache from IIS. In our situation, it would sometimes appear even upon an initial connection from a user after attempting to authenticate against LDAP. This was after the web server daemon was online for a few hours (four). The end user, if they entered their username/password correctly (or perhaps incorrectly too) would immediately get a 500 Internal Server error message, and an entry like this would be logged:  [Mon Apr 23 12:05:36 2007] [warn] [client 101.10.115.53] [21514] auth_ldap authenticate: user tracy authentication failed; URI /em/gs [LDAP: ldap_simple_bind_s() failed][Can't contact LDAP server]  			Brad Nicholes	John Tracy	Rob Baily

But....  The parent doesn't free the 'child_exit_event' which was duplicated for the  child so a reference is held by the parent and must be free'd or the handle  leaks.

Although we have to close it before the return because we are about to signal it in the shutdown case further down.  So the most sensible patch is to close it immediate before the two return cases.

41097	null	RESOLVED		Dan Harkless	1164990060000	1185887433000		X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Server header addition by mod_proxy_http undocumented It's not documented that mod_proxy_http (starting in httpd 2.0.15) adds X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Server HTTP headers.  These are very useful to know about so that if you utilize a reverse proxy you'll know how to modify the LogFormat on your destination webserver to log actual client IPs rather than just the IP address of the proxy.  (And so you'll know that with recent versions of httpd, you don't need to install the third-party mod_proxy_add_forward module, as much advice online says to do.)  In the documentation it would be good to note that if traffic has an existing X-Forwarded-For: header, it will be overwritten by the Apache reverse proxy with its IP, rather than appending its IP to the value of that header as some other proxies do.  You might even give the configuration code from http://groups.google.com/group/alt.apache.configuration/msg/6f0ecadabc20623f as an example of how to always log the client IP in the first field, regardless of whether the particular connection went through the reverse proxy.  If you do that, though, you should probably add a note that malicious parties not going through the reverse proxy could hide their IP addresses from the logs by adding their own X-Forwarded-For headers, so for security it's better to log *both* the  value of %h and %{X-Forwarded-For}i.	IME Apache 2.2.0 used as a reverse proxy *does* append to an existing X-Forwarded-For header.  When I access a private server at work from my home machine, I connect via a forward proxy (Squid 2.6) on my home machine, an authenticating reverse proxy (Apache 2.2.0) on the remote firewall, and a reverse proxy (Apache 2.2.0) on the remote DMZ machine.  The server (running under Tomcat 5.5) has a facility for reporting the headers in the request it receives, and the X-Forwarded-For: header contains the private IP address of my home machine (added by Squid), the public IP address of my home machine (added by the firewall Apache), and the DMZ IP address of the remote firewall (added by the DMZ Apache).  As I would expect. These headers are now somewhat documented on trunk. Thanks.			Dave Sparks	Joshua Slive

If they aren't needed, delete them.  General review: - don't log anything in the ssl_cmd_* functions, this doesn't add much - don't invent macros for logging in ssl_ocsp.c, just use ap_log_* directly - when and where is NO_OCSP supposed to be defined?  this needs an autoconf check presumably; call the define MODSSL_something - if it's useful for users to be able configure a proxy make it properly configurable, otherwise remove the debugging code - X509_Int2Str() should be static and have a name outside a namespace owned by OpenSSL.  Use of the static result buffer inside is not thread-safe. - use pools not malloc - using pools, and pool cleanups, or just better function structure, should be able to eliminate the excessive use of goto in VerifyOCSP - GetExtensionValue looks scary.  Why is this not looking up extensions by NID, can X509_get_ext_d2i not be used here? - also a bit scared about using the toy HTTP/1.0 client in OpenSSL :( I modified and cleaned up the code as requested; I will upload a new patch.  Some questions:  1. I used the connection pool for memory allocation: c->pool from ssl_callback_SSLVerify_Validity(). Is that correct ? I did not use any pool cleanup, as this will be closed at the end of the connection.  2. I originally added the #ifdef NOOCSP in case you want a version that is compiled with this code. Is this really needed ? Can I remove it ?  3. Should I replace the HTTP connection by some calls to some Apache API ? Which API is available ?  4. Probably dependent to the previous question, is there any global setting defining a proxy to call when opening an outgoing HTTP(S) connection ? I could define it for the OCSP call only, but some other code (even external modules) could also need it; this would lead to the same info being defined several time. Should I implement it only for my code ? Or can I assume that the server will always have a direct access to the OCSP server ?  Is it possible to use mod_proxy connection pools ? This would make sense, although the outgoing connection pool should go out from mod_proxy to a separate module in order to be reusable by every module ... This would maybe be the future best track, but it sounds a bit heavy to reimplement all mod_proxy connection pool handling just for the OCSP connection. Can we leave this as a future improvement and currently use the OpenSSL connection (which works well in practice in several very big eGov sites) ?

Unfortunately the request_rec structure is not set in SSL_get_app_exdata2() at the time it is needed and there doesn't appear to be an easy way to obtain it. This may be because the requested page is unknown at this time because the SSL handshake is in progress and no HTTP headers have been sent. Does this make sub requests a non starter for OCSP or is it possible to use an alternative technique? *** Bug 31383 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Yes it doesn't look like use of mod_proxy subrequests will be possible unfortunately, per discussion on dev@.

Created an attachment (id=21130) attempt 1 of refactored OCSP support  This is the cleaned up version of Marc's OCSP patch, diff relative to the trunk.\t  Relative changes:  - moves OCSP code to ssl_engine_ocsp.c - heavily refactors, cleans up, simplifies code style etc in the above - tones down the debugging a lot.  some common helper functions are needed in ssl_engine_log.c to log cert subject name etc, if desired - updates config.m4 - removed error handling for OpenSSL functions which can only fail on OOM - removed poorly-named SSLOCSPResponderVerify (can be added back separately) - removed addition of SSLForceValidation, which is orthogonal to basic OCSP support (likewise add separately later) - reworked the config options to be:      SSLOCSPEnable <bool>     SSLOCSPOverrideResponder <bool>     SSLOCSPDefaultResponder <URL>    rather than redundantly having two directives to supply a URL. - simplify unnecessarily complex status/error handling for OCSP code   This is untested since my OCSP test setup is broken currently, so it probably doesn't actually work.

The #include in ssl_toolkit_compat.h > should be sufficient. Some general Apache include files end up in including standard MS SDK. In latest SDK, MS defines some types if they are not defined yet. These types are defined by OpenSSL, so they have to be included before SDK .h, so before Apache .h. This could also be done in ssl_private.h: either include 'openssl/ocsp.h' before Apache files, or 'ssl_toolkit_compat.h', or all 'ssl*.h' files. (In reply to comment #27) > - removed addition of SSLForceValidation, which is orthogonal to basic OCSP This is a very important feature (also for other validation mechanisms, like CRL or, maybe in the future LDAP). Without that, the administrator cannot decide what to do when no validation mechanism is available (OCSp responder not available, or CRL files not up to date). Depending on the server security level, the implementation will either be seen as conatining a security hole (the cert is accepted although it is invalid),  or it will be considered as too strict (blocking valid users because of third party infrastsucture problems). This is a feature that we see as crucial for most of the application owners. (In reply to comment #30) > (In reply to comment #27) > > - removed addition of SSLForceValidation, which is orthogonal to basic OCSP > This is a very important feature (also for other validation mechanisms, like   Yes, that's fine, but it's also orthogonal to getting basic OCSP support working, so it can be added afterwards.  Removing the intrusive changes to the verification callback makes the basic code easier to review and test. Some comments on the latest patch.  1. The function extract_responder_uri() has a memory leak. It should call:  AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS_free(values);  instead of:  sk_ACCESS_DESCRIPTION_free(values);  2. After the call to apr_uri_parse() shouldn't we check the scheme is really 'http'? I've heard of some responders which use 'https'. There is also the possibility that the URL will be split up into a path and query string which should be concatenated when passed to OpenSSL.  3. The OCSP query code doesn't include a timeout. This is a problem with the OpenSSL's rather simplistic OCSP handler and the fact that there is no generalized socket timeout code in OpenSSL. There are several ways to work around this. The easiest is to use APR sockets with a timeout. See my OCSP query code in Bug 43822  4. The code unconditionally uses an OCSP nonce. Some responders do not sign every request but just server pre-cached responses. As a result the nonce value can't be honoured and an error will occur when attempting to use such responders. The most notable example is VeriSign's OCSP responder but there are others.  Created an attachment (id=21193) updated patch  Changes in second patch:  1) fixed to check URI scheme, and correctly free 'values' stack per Steve's comment  2) drop the duplicate X509_STORE_CTX & X509_STORE creation.  I can't see why this is necessary; Marc, can you explain what that was for?  OCSP_basic_verify() creates its own X509_STORE_CTX anyway in which to do the verify the response signature, so it was never used directly.  Dropping this doesn't seem to make any difference to result in testing, either.  Was this just here to allow for future customisation of how the response signature is verified?  3) simplified some more logging/debugging.  Uses the new ssl_log_cxerror() function added on the trunk to log cert details as context.  Steve, thanks for a lot for the review - agree with your points (3) and (4) but would like to address these later. [adding CC] >  > 2) drop the duplicate X509_STORE_CTX & X509_STORE creation.  I can't see why > this is necessary; Marc, can you explain what that was for?    I haven't tested it explicitly but I think the extra X509_STORE and ctx was intended to extract the issuer certificate from the client certificate in a reliable way.  Note that X509_STORE_CTX_get1_issuer() will only retrieve the issuer certificate if it is trusted, hence the extra store to make all certificates trusted. To see why suppose you have this situation:  Root->Intermediate->Cert  Where Root only is trusted. The client would send Cert and Intermediate. The OpenSSL validation logic would then build the whole chain.  A call to X509_STORE_CTX_get1_issuer() would fail because Intermediate is not in the trusted store.  In actual fact it isn't necessary to create a separate store because the certificate chain has already been built and validated. All you should need to do is to extract the second member of the validated chain like this....  issuer = sk_X509_value(X509_STORE_CTX_get_chain(ctx), 1); if (issuer == NULL) /* Error */  Since issuer is an internal pointer it shouldn't be freed as it will be freed up when the ctx is cleaned up.  Oh and btw you do need to free up certID.  OK, but the SSLVerify callback (and hence this OCSP validation code) is invoked for each and (necessarily) every cert from the root CA down to the peer's certificate, to verify the complete chain - so:  1) we must always be able to assume that the issuer of the X509_STORE_CTX_get_current_cert() cert is trusted, since otherwise we wouldn't get this far?  2) sk_X509_value(X509_STORE_CTX_get_chain(ctx), 1) is not necessarily the issuer of the current cert - it might *be* the current cert?  ...right?  Or am I missing something fundamental?

Changes:  1) factors out the HTTP client into ssl_util_ocsp, and re-implements using APR functions directly; fixing I/O timeout handling, server address handling, and adding response memory use constraints rather than streaming into RAM indefinitely (!) as the OpenSSL code does.  Also allows this code to be easily switched out for a Real HTTP Client (TM) later.  2) removes the debugging code which dumps base64-encoded which seems overkill; tcpdump/wireshark works for such case.  3) use a temporary pool to constrain connection pool memory use  >  > 1) we must always be able to assume that the issuer of the > X509_STORE_CTX_get_current_cert() cert is trusted, since otherwise we wouldn't > get this far? >   I'll check the current patch.

If you make OCSP calls inside the verification callback the chain may not be fully trusted when you make the OCSP requests. This would allow a carefully constructed certificate chain to persuade a server to make arbitrary OCSP requests to any URL.

This would allow a carefully > constructed certificate chain to persuade a server to make arbitrary OCSP > requests to any URL. Some would regard this as undesirable.  If the cert being verified is not trusted the SSLVerify callback will get invoked with ok=0 though surely? (the OCSP code won't get invoked in that case, only if the cert *is* trusted)   But I did find this confusing, anyway.  Is it at all desirable to be doing OCSP validation of every cert in the chain, including whatever root CA?  Marc, was the code written like this deliberately?  It would be simple enough to only do the OCSP validation for the actual peer cert. It wasn't quite as bad as I originally though. The final verification step is the signature validation of each cert in the chain. So if that is successful the callback is called ok==1 for each cert in the chain.   I thought that the chain went leaf to root which would have allowed arbitrary URIs from a bogus chain.  Instead it goes root to leaf which isn't as bad but would allow a bogus EE cert to trigger chain validation because it isn't checked until the end.  As things stand the current_issuer field of X509_STORE_CTX can be used to obtain the issuer cert. Think that was first added in OpenSSL 0.9.7.  The only other case is when ok is set to 1 because it tolerates an earlier error. That could end up doing an OCSP (and CRL) check twice AFAICS.    Committed to trunk:  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=599385  thanks to all for the patches, review, and patience to those who have worked on this.  Further work:  * add config options to configure whether CRL-and/or-OCSP validation is mandatory as in the 'ForceValidation' config option, whether a nonce is used, what verification flags are passed to OCSP_basic_verify()  * move verification to per-location context?  patches welcome for all the above!  Marking this fixed; for issues with the committed code please file new bugs or mail dev@httpd, likewise for discussion of above future work.  (and as always, patches welcome!)

If you compromise the intermediate certificate, you could create a fake OCSP server, with responses that will be accepted by Apache. The only way to ensure the OCSP response is valid is to validate its certificate, and the same up to the root.			Dr Stephen Henson	Joe Orton	Marc Stern	Michal Prochazka	Ruediger Pluem	Wolfram Joost

(In reply to comment #3) > A simpler fix would just be to check strlen of the date at the top of the > function, wouldn't it?  Not quite, because the length varies per date format. Well, let's make it less likely to bite us later.  Created an attachment (id=19299) proxy canon date gmt  The first patch version incorrectly converted the time in local timezone instead of GMT. Both your patches are identical - but they're more sensible than the original code.  I'm updating it to use gmt as you intended, and made the tiny optimisation of avoiding a copy. Created an attachment (id=19301) updated patch on 2.2  Should've mentioned: my patch relies on Davi's patch to have got the format right:-)  More importantly, this needs to be applied to trunk ahead of 2.2.x.

What is missing that -DNO_DETACH (prevent the parent from forking) and  -DFOREGROUND (prevent the parent from calling setsid() et al) do not provide?  Use of some hack like -C 'ErrorLog '|cat'' can force error logging to stderr, possibly some easier way with -E and /proc/*/fd. joe, hi,  thanks for pointing that out!  i'll try it out.  funny.  been looking for this for nearly 18 months, and richard's been looking for it for probably three years.  i'll boot up my laptop with depinit on it and let you know, straight away, if it works.  ok: yes, that works as expected.  so the question becomes, really, how come two experienced linux developers could not find that option, easily, by looking in every place that they could think of?  man pages, online, documentation - nothing mentions -DFOREGROUND in any of the kinds of prominent places in which you'd expect to find advice on how to run the world's most popular web server in a mode which dramatically changes how it operates.  bizarre!   Obligatory 'use the source, Luke' jokes aside, no answers... changing to Docs bug. Added to the docs for httpd -D in trunk.			Joe Orton	Joshua Slive	Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton

Since query-string parameters are used to associate unique meta-information to each request mod_cache will treat each request as a new request. Since mod_cache is run as a quick handler it is not possible to use mod_rewrite to remove the query-string part of the request.  I believe this should be considered a relevant scenario, and that an option to disable this behaviour is motivated.  I am including a patch for this below.

Forgot one thing:  Please put  int ignorequerystring; int ignorequerystring_set;  at the end of the cache_server_conf struct to avoid binary incompatibility and thus the need for a major bump. A patch that creates binary incompatibility cannot be backported to 2.2.x. Putting them to the end of the structure only requires a minor bump which can be backported (include/ap_mmn.h).

41796	null	RESOLVED		Michael Krieger	1173376140000	1173685807000		Internal Dummy Connection should process effortlessly It's clear that the Internal Dummy Connection requests are needed and it is my understanding that these exist in 2.0 but however are not logged.  My concern is not with them existing or logging, but with the request that is being made. The 'GET /' request used causes dynamic pages to generate- in some cases with tens or hundreds of requests in a matter of a few seconds.  A dynamic page I have shows these Internal dummy connections making tens of database queries to generate and returning 100-200KB of data to the dummy connection.  This should be changed to either:  a) request something else other than 'GET /', such as using 'OPTIONS *', or 'GET /robots.txt' or 'GET /apache_internal_dummy_file.txt' that would not be used or would not incur the massive processing of many of today's Web sites.  -OR- (better yet)  b) be handled specially by the request handler that in the case of a connection from the local IP with that user agent, it should avoid as much advanced processing as possible(rewrite rules, PHP scripts, Perl scripts, SSI, Directory restrictions, htaccess processing, etc), and simply return a very short 'ACK' style request with only the necessary headers to be deemed valid.  When the whole server approaches the request limit near the same time or receives certain commands that dispatch these, it is important that it is not making requests it shouldn't.  Advertisers and users depend on these database requests to count pageviews and other measures that Apache suddenly adds hundreds of throughout a day... which can add up and show a difference in pageviews from what actually is occuring.	My TEMPORARY solution was to create these virtualhosts (apparently it's an IP6 request in my configuration, so I needed the second).  <Virtualhost 127.0.0.1>         ServerName      localhost         DocumentRoot    /var/www </VirtualHost> <Virtualhost [::1]>         ServerName      localhost         DocumentRoot    /var/www </VirtualHost>  At least these I know will return MY dummy file instead of a huge PHP script where the database queries and numbers do matter.  However, this issue needs to be addressed if this method is used to wake up the children.  Making requests blindly and without care to a Web server can throw off numbers in more than the logs in an era where everything is dynamic.  The REQUEST FILE either NEEDS to be configurable, or the HOST NEEDS to be configurable, or the request TYPE needs to be harmless and dealt with internally, or the request needs to be silently handled internally without doing any processing.  Either way really, with the preference being internally handling it, then changing the type.

41798	null	RESOLVED		Mike Cardwell	1173406800000	1206978180000		mod_proxy rewrites url paths badly This is related to bugs 39746 and 38448.  After turning on AllowEncodedSlashes, Apache lets us use percent encoded forward slashes in the path. Eg:  'http://foo/hello%2Fworld'  When using 'ProxyPass / http://bar/'  mod_proxy makes a request for:  'http://bar/hello/world'  That is wrong as I understand it. The forward slash at the end should be encoded still.  RFC-1738, section 3.3 regarding HTTP URLs:  'Within the <path> and <searchpart> components, '/', ';', '?' are reserved. The '/' character may be used within HTTP to designate a hierarchical structure.'  So... The forward slash is a reserved character. Section 2.2 says the following about reserved characters:  'If the character corresponding to an octet is reserved in a scheme, the octet must be encoded.'  So as far as I can see http://foo/hello%2Fworld and http://foo/hello/world are distinctly different HTTP URLs that should be allowed to behave differently. Just because Apache treats them the same when serving local content, doesn't mean that other servers do when you're proxying the request to them, so I don't think the path should be rewritten in the way mod_proxy is doing it...  Perhaps there should be an option called something like 'ProxyPreservePathEncoding' which when turned on, means that *no* encoding/decoding of the path in the url is performed before it is proxied...  If my browser makes a request for 'http://foo/hello%2Fworld' and I have 'ProxyPass / http://bar/' I *expect* it to call 'http://bar/hello%2Fworld' not 'http://bar/hello/world' as it does currently. It *should* be the default behaviour, but that would probably not be backwards compatible.  Mike	*** Bug 35100 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 42592 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 39455 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Fixed in Trunk in r588791. Fixed in r596712. I have an instance of mod_proxy doing reverse proxying using the 'nocanon' parameter in the ProxyPass directive. The reason I needed this was that I'm dealing with IRIs on the path, and mod_proxy was decoding the characters for me.  In any case, I find that when 'nocanon' is turned on, mod_proxy appends the query twice and sent it to the target host, e.g.:  Original request:  http://mod-proxy-host.com/path?query  The target was sent:  http://localhost:8003/target?query?query   This seems to be due to r->unparsed_uri containing the original query, whereas r->uri doesn't (and other parts of the code appends it to the target.) Created an attachment (id=21743) Proof-of-concept that fixes the issue  This is meant to demonstrate that it fixes the issue. However, I have not checked for security issues or whether it breaks other configurations. Comments 6 and 7 appear to be opening a new report.  Please don't hijack an old report for that.

In the backtrace below thread 2 is holding this lock and preventing all the worker threads from doing their jobs (they need to get hold of this lock). OTH thread 2 waits for a free worker via a conditional wait. BOOOM. Created an attachment (id=20684) 2.2.x deadlock fix  Here is a patch that might fix this issue on 2.2.x.  I haven't been able to locally reproduce it --  can you please try this patch out and let me know if it fixes the issue?  This reorders the locking logic inside the timeout ring iteration, so that we only lock when doing ops on the ring, but once we are ready to push to a child, we are lock free. I've committed a potential fix to trunk with r567852: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=567852  The approach is different form the patch attached here -- it avoids rewriting the loops. > Here is a patch that might fix this issue on 2.2.x.

Please update to trunk again, I believe I have fixed the last crash with r568202: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=568202 I tried two source trees: (A)rev 568202 (B)rev 568202 + revert r567852 ( svn merge -r 567852:567851 ./ )  (A) works fine, there seems to be no issues.

(5) terminate downloading then child freezes.  Reproducing the deadlock issue on (A) is harder than on (B), so r567852 is effective but not complete, IMHO. I took a bachtrace of a frozen child process. The bt was the same as  bt I have posted in April.  'Reproducing the deadlock issue on (A) is harder than on (B)' was how I felt,  but now seems wrong. I tried 2.2 and reproduced the deadlock, so I tried that patch against 2.2.

I think 'Deny from all' is wasteful.  Require valid-user Order allow,deny Allow from 192.168.1 Satisfy Any You are right, if the Order statement is 'Order allow,deny'.

It would be good to know whether Davi's patch at least stops the crashing. Davi's fix does work, tested on the same server, crashing stopped. This got fixed in trunk but missed the changelog.

Code needs changed to match docs.  Also needs backports.	Created an attachment (id=20686) patch typo  The attached patch changes the code rather than the docs. Could dev@ confirm that the code rather than  the docs are wrong?  If not I'll fix up the docs. Please fix the docs. Thus we avoid regressions with configurations in the wild that found out this situation and adjusted their config to the code. What about all those that have read the docs, have their configs set as such?  Those people continue to have broken setups if you fix the docs.  Changing the code will at least allow people using the proxy-sendchunked env var to start working in the next release.  I think the chances of someone noticing this in the code and adjusting their configs is much less than someone following the docs and never verifying that it was working.  Look how long this bug has been there as proof of this. If you do decide to fix the docs, please fix the code comments as well. Grepping the (trunk) sources gives:  ./docs/manual/env.html.en:329:   <h3><a name='proxy' id='proxy'>force-proxy-request-1.0, proxy-nokeepalive, proxy- sendchunked, proxy-sendcl</a></h3> ./docs/manual/env.html.ja.euc-jp:321:   <h3><a name='proxy' id='proxy'>force-proxy-request-1.0, proxy-nokeepalive,  proxy-sendchunked, proxy-sendcl</a></h3> ./docs/manual/env.xml:369:   <section id='proxy'><title>force-proxy-request-1.0, proxy-nokeepalive, proxy-sendchunked,  proxy-sendcl</title> ./docs/manual/env.xml.ja:356:   <section id='proxy'><title>force-proxy-request-1.0, proxy-nokeepalive, proxy- sendchunked, proxy-sendcl</title> ./docs/manual/mod/mod_proxy.html.en:289:    <code>proxy-sendchunked</code> minimizes resource usage by using ./docs/manual/mod/mod_proxy.xml:260:    <code>proxy-sendchunked</code> minimizes resource usage by using ./modules/proxy/mod_proxy_http.c:910:     *   not setenv proxy-sendchunked or has set setenv proxy-sendcl ./modules/proxy/mod_proxy_http.c:913:     *   setenv proxy-sendcl, and not setenv proxy-sendchunked ./modules/proxy/mod_proxy_http.c:915:     * If both proxy-sendcl and proxy-sendchunked are set, the ./modules/proxy/mod_proxy_http.c:921:     * To reduce server resource use,   setenv proxy-sendchunked  So it's clear that there's some confusion over the variable name. In fact, there's more references to 'proxy-sendchunked' in the  code comments than there are in the docs.  I was about to commit a sed-style fix to the trunk docs, but I'm holding off in case send-chunked (which seems to me a better  phrase) wins out over send-chunks (which at least has comical value to the English :) My suggestion: Double-check that all docs say 'chunked' instead of 'chunks'. For code in 2.0.x and 2.2.x 'stable' branches, check for 'chunked' like the docs say now, as well as 'chunks' which somebody who read the code might use. For code in trunk, check only 'chunked'.  Created an attachment (id=20699) Check for both -s and -ed variants in 2.2  Check for both sendchunks and sendchunked in 2.2 following from Jeff Trawick's suggestion. Brian's original patch for trunk is also valid. No changes required for the 2.2 docs, or any comments in the C code. Created an attachment (id=20700) Check for -s and -ed variants in 2.0  Again following from Jeff Trawick's suggestion, this time for 2.0. The 2.0 docs don't mention either variant in env.xml, so I guess there's no changes to make there.  Please review the logic of both patches carefully, as I'm not a C coder and not particularly confident that it's right. Sorry, been busy ;)  The patches in comments #8 and #9 look fine.  I have not tested, though (no time) as I applied my patch to our 2.2.x tree.  Thanks Vincent!  -B Backported to 2.2.x as r572421 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=572421&view=rev).

Patch looks ok to me. Here is the description of the bug :  In ap_vrprintf, vrprintf_buf is a array allocated on stack of 8192 bytes. ap_vrprintf invokes ap_vformatter to format the string.  ap_vformatter prints the data character by character, if buffer is overflowed, then it flushes the data and reset the vdbuf.curpos to beginning of buffer.  If  the size of the output is a multiplication of 8192 then after ap_vformatter returns, vbuff.curpos just passes one byte after the allocated value. (ap_vformatter himself doesn't write beyond the allocated buffer). We can't write NULL to this value as it overflow the buffer.  For a request with /test/?8192, here is the debugger session :  Breakpoint 1, ap_vrprintf (r=0x91f6028, fmt=0xd137af '%s', va=0xb731d218 '(??M/t/005')     at protocol.c:1530 1530        vd.vbuff.curpos = vrprintf_buf; (gdb) n 1531        vd.vbuff.endpos = vrprintf_buf + AP_IOBUFSIZE; (gdb) n 1532        vd.r = r; (gdb) n 1533        vd.buff = vrprintf_buf; (gdb) n 1535        if (r->connection->aborted) (gdb) n 1538        written = apr_vformatter(r_flush, &vd.vbuff, fmt, va); (gdb) n 1541        *(vd.vbuff.curpos) = '/0'; (gdb) p vd.vbuff.curpos - vrprintf_buf $1 = 8192 (gdb) p sizeof(vrprintf_buf) $2 = 8192 (gdb)  This patch deletes the statement which sets the null value. This null value is not used later in the function. buffer_output function flushes rest of the data and it doesn't see the data beyond vdbuff.curpos.

Appears to be caused by lack of validaton bytes where they are expected. Commenting out validation bytes checking in mod_deflate.c does not fix the problem. Size of compressed data is reported as 1 byte in ctx->stream.total_in, uncompressed is 0. Condition can be provoked by requesting:  www.cnn.com www.ebay.com  Probably others as well	Can you please provide the changes that made it work for you as a patch. Even if this is not the solution is would be helpful for analysis of the problem. I just tested both www.cnn.com and www.ebay.com (using my apache as forward proxy and commandline telnet to request uncompressed output), and got the correctly-uncompressed output.  You've been confusing yourself and scaring the rest of us on IRC for rather a long time.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to revert to a clean 2.2.6 install, and work from there. Nick,  In order to duplicate this bug, you need to be using Apache with mod_proxy enabled and mod_deflate in the filter chain set to INFLATE gzip-ed content. I'll be attached an httpd.conf for Apache 2.2.6 that  provokes the buggy behavior. Created an attachment (id=20897) httpd config for  provoking mod_deflate bug  Also, forgot to mention two things:  1. Setting VALIDATON_SIZE to 0 fixes the problem when it pops up 2. Both cnn.com and ebay.com do occasionally send all 8 validation bytes. Please try making the request a few times before you conclude that there's nothing broken   Please set up a testcase for the alleged bug, so I can reproduce it. You can use mod_asis to set exact headers, as well as the gzipped data. I'm working on a test case for you, but the bug is really not at all hard to reproduce. It shows up both with 2.2.6 and TRUNK. Both cnn.com and ebay.com routinely fail more than 50% of the time with both Firefox 1.5 and 2.0. I have been so far unable to reproduce this bug by copying the responses geneated by  by perl IO::Socket to .asis files. In such cases, the files are rendered perfectly through INFLATE. I will continue my attempts at creating a better test case but I'm quite exhausted at this point.  Please note that this really is a bug and not a configuration issue. I would be glad to give someone access to my server if it allows him/her to more expediently identify that this is indeed a bug and not a figment of my imagination.  Hopefully someone can take a look at this thing in earnest; I have not been having a pleasant time trying to fix it myself. Another bit of information:  The log output in error_log is Zlib: Validation bytes not present I was able to reproduce this intermittently (2 requests fail w/ 0 length body, then a success) with:  LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so  ProxyPass /proxy/  http://www.cnn.com/ LoadModule ext_filter_module modules/mod_ext_filter.so ExtFilterDefine foo mode=output cmd='/usr/bin/perl -p -e 's/^/|/g'' ftype=21 <location /proxy/> ExtFilterOptions debuglevel=999 Setoutputfilter INFLATE;foo;DEFLATE </location>  I sent a request with wget and --header='Accept-Encoding: gzip' Fixed in trunk - r580598.  I expect you'll report back whether this fixes it for you.  Comments: (1) Easy once I could reproduce the problem.

43534	null	RESOLVED		Tom Donovan	1191298080000	1200743397000		mod_perl and FastCGI fails on Windows The changes in APR 1.2.10+ and Apache 2.2.6 caused mod_perl 2.0.3 to fail on Windows.  mod_perl attempts to save stdin and stdout on entry and restore them on exit.  mod_perl uses POSIX-like int file descriptors - _fileno(stdin) and _fileno(stdout) - for this.  These file descriptors are not updated by setting STD_INPUT_HANDLE and STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE via SetStdHandle(). For example, SetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE, newhand) does not change the HANDLE associated with _fileno(stdin). _fileno(stdin) still refers to the original Windows HANDLE  - the pipe handle, regardless of whether it is open or has been closed.  This can be seen by comparing the return value from GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE) to the value from _get_osfhandle(_fileno(stdin)) before and after mpm_winnt.c replaces the stdin handle.  mpm_winnt currently creates a HANDLE to 'NUL' as a replacement stdout when Apache is run as a Windows Service.  Because a console-device HANDLE is not useable (always returns 'invalid handle') when it is inherited by a detached process, this is needed for command-line too.  Attached is a patch to mpm_winnt (2.2.x branch) which:  1. Creates the 'NUL' stdout in the parent for both service and cmd-line execution, rather than just for service. Only single-process mode (-X) retains the original console-device stdout HANDLE.  2. Uses _dup2() in the child to replace the stdin file descriptor with the stdout file descriptor (i.e. to set stdout to 'NUL' except in single-process mode).  Note that this has the side-effect of closing the regular Windows HANDLE to the stdin pipe too, so it must be done after the child is done reading from the parent.  3. Sets the Windows HANDLEs (but not the file descriptors) for stdout and stderr to INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE at child_init for FastCGI modules. See APR bug 43329.  This would allow current Windows FastCGI modules to work with APR 1.2.10+ without requiring APR_NO_FILE flag changes until a major Apache release, while other non-Apache APR programs could still take advantage of the APR process creation changes.  This patch works with mod_fastcgi, mod_fcgid, and mod_perl on Win2k and Vista when built with either VC6 and VS8.	Created an attachment (id=20905) mod_perl and FastCGI patch  Allows mod_perl and FastCGI programs to run with Apache 2.2.6 on Windows Typo in 2. above - I meant:  '(i.e. to set stdin to 'NUL' except in single-process mode)'  Also observed that this patch does not interfere with the new APR behavior re: not leaking unwanted handles.  rotatelogs.exe works as expected with APR 1.2.10+.  Created an attachment (id=21264) new patch for 2.2.x branch 12/12/2007  Updated patch for 2.2.x trunk (revision 603073 - Dec 12, 2007).    Per Bug 43329 - reverting the apr_proc_create behavior fixes the problem for new processes created by mod_fastcgi or mod_fcgid.  STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE and STD_ERROR_HANDLE are now INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE as required.  The Apache child process itself must be created with valid stdout and stdin file descriptors (vs. HANDLEs) for modules which use fd's. It is OK for these to be file descriptors to 'NUL'.  This patch always creates the Apache child with 'NUL' as stdout, which the child later _dup2's to stdin after all the info has been collected from the parent via the stdin pipe.  This leaves the Apache child with acceptable fd's for stdin and stdout to satisfy modules which use fd's instead of HANDLEs (like mod_perl).  I'm reviewing the patch I had already authored (see URL above) which applied to both 2.2.x and 2.0.x branches.  I'll then examine that it meets the requirements of the patch Tom has attached to this incident, because I think it covers all the bases but need to confirm.  If anyone else active in resolving this bug is interested, the current httpd 2.2.x branch from svn, and the 1.2.12 apr[-util] release (or 1.2.x svn branch) can be used to verify the current behavior before release. (In reply to comment #4) > I'm reviewing the patch I had already authored (see URL above) which applied > to both 2.2.x and 2.0.x branches.  Not sure which 'URL above' is meant here.  The current revision of the 2.2.x branch (rev 607543 30-Dec-2007), which includes change 607311 to mpm_winnt.c, will run mod_perl only when Apache is started as a Windows service.  If Apache is started from the command line, the error when mod_perl is invoked is:   Failed to dup STDOUT: Bad file descriptor.  [Sun Dec 30 08:18:22 2007] [notice] Parent: child process exited with status 9 -- Restarting.  It is a welcome improvement that mod_perl errors (like 'Failed to dup') now appear in the error log. Created an attachment (id=21351) Updated patch for 2.2.7  Updated patch to work with Apache 2.2.7 RC.  Only the command-line case needed to be fixed.    mpm_winnt already creates a stdout handle to 'NUL', but only when started as a Windows Service.  This 'NUL' handle is acceptable to mod_perl as both stdin and stdout.  Since console handles don't inherit - when Apache is started from the command-line mod_perl gets an invalid stdout. This patch changes mpm_winnt to *always* create a 'NUL' stdout handle when creating a child process, for both Windows service and command-line startup.  Single-process mode (-X) has always worked with mod_perl.  There is no process creation, therefore no handle inheritance is involved.\tBecause the original (real) console handles are valid, mod_perl runs correctly. Troubles with this patch; it doesn't mirror unix behavior (which is actually right in this case) and it introduces a service regression just as the earlier patch I committed introduced a console regression.  The unix behavior is that the stdout channel should be fixed at the moment that  configure is finished.  This ensures any normal emits from perl, etc are seen in the parent by the user.  I'm working to track down where that happens, it may be at daemonize() and actually embedded in apr, and I'm looking at a best solution to mirror unix.  The regression is that stdio (and stderr and stdin) are third rails in a service that we can't touch before they have been repaired.  The existing location of the stdout substitution can't and won't be changed.  Thanks for the patch and the thorough explanation on dev@httpd, I'm proceeding with the patch that will resolve this without modifying unix nor services.   Here we go;  on Unix, apr_proc_detach(1) causes all of the descriptors to be replaced with the /dev/null handle, and this is precisely the behavior we want.  Today on unix this occurs in pre_config (c.f. worker.c and prefork.c).  However this behavior is a bit borked in the minds of some developers, who are frustrated with the fact that perl emits that showed up in 1.3 no longer show up in 2.0. But I can agree for now that we have to mirror unix, at least our register_hooks and earlier pre_config hooks will mirror unix.  See the revised patch which only modifies normal console-mode operation at;    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=609354  review and let me know if this satisfies your test cases, and I'll backport ASAP.   Corrected patch cited (now that I can take it to win32).  Sorry the initial backport was actually from unix.  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/server/mpm/winnt/mpm_winnt.c?r1=607677&r2=609366   (In reply to comment #9) r609366 applied to Apache 2.2.7 works as expected.  Windows-service, command-line, and single-process (-X) all run mod_perl OK with this change.  Command-line startup with no console also works OK - e.g. 'START /B httpd.exe' or Apache started via CreateProcess(...DETACHED_PROCESS...).  Backported to both 2.0 and 2.2, I think we can at last tag this FIXED for the forthcoming 2.2.8 and 2.0.63 releases.  Thanks for all of your help Tom!

Thanks for the kind words - but you may not want to thank me just yet.  I failed to notice that with the current fix, closing the Apache window does not shut down Apache (presuming a window is displayed) .  Ditto for right-click [Close] on the task-bar icon.  This was not a problem with the previous patch, so somehow the windows console (vs. the child window itself) is not associated with the parent process with this fix.  I see this on Win2k and Steffen reports the same on XP. I regret we didn't catch this quicker. Fixed in 2.2.8.			Ruediger Pluem	Tom Donovan	Will Rowe
43562	null	RESOLVED		Jose Kahan	1191574800000	1208419092000		PR 21059 is not needed anymore and has degraded the use of mod_speling; please suprress Please remove PR 21059 from mod_speling as it has downgraded the behavior of Apache 2.2 and also because bug 21059 was solved by changes elsewhere in the code. The patch I'm submitting effectively deletes PR 21059.  Detailed report:  Way back in 2003, the following dependency was added to mod_speling:check_speling(), as an attempt to fix bug report # 21059 [1] for Apache 2.0.45. This patch was apparently applied only to the 2.2 tree:  [[     /* we default to reject path info (same as core handler) */     if ((r->used_path_info != AP_REQ_ACCEPT_PATH_INFO) &&         r->path_info && *r->path_info) {         return DECLINED;     } ]]  This patch has had a bad side effect on Apache 2.2: use of mod_speling is now conditioned to the use of AcceptPathInfo; it's not possible anymore to use mod_speling without having AcceptPathInfo turned on.  With all due respect, I believe that the correct approach would have rather been to add a directive similar to mod_mime's ModMimeUsePathInfo [2], which is 'is used to combine the filename with the path_info URL component to apply mod_mime's directives to the request.' This requires a deeper code change than what the patch proposed.  This patch has also downgraded the behavior of Apache 2.2; if you were using mod_speling, URIs that returned status 404 under Apache 1.3 are now returning status 200, because you need to enable AcceptPathInfo to be able to use mod_speling.  If we look at bug report 21059, I see that it is describing a standard behavior in Apache 1.3:    1. the client passed a path_info in its request       http://www.abcdatos.com/programas/traductores/   2. mod_negotiation (and not mod_speling), converted the URI to:       http://www.abcdatos.com/programas/traductores/'  The real bug here, according to the report, is that the server returns 404, regardless of the user's enabling of AcceptPathInfo. Up to this moment, mod_speling has not been concerned: there has been no spelling correction.  Let's jump  back to the future and to Apache 2.2. I made the following tests (detailed results here below):  1. Apache 1.3 with mod_speling 2. Apache 2.2.4; mod_speling with PR 21059 and AcceptPathInfo enabled 3. Apache 2.2.4; mod_speling without PR 21059 removed and AcceptPathInfo  disabled 4. Apache 2.2.4; mod_sepling witout PR 21059 and AcceptPathInfo enabled  To summarize the results, removing the patch to mod_speling and disabling AcceptPathInfo gives us the same behavior as with Apache 1.3. Moreover, removing the patch and enabling AcceptPathInfo does pass the path info to the resource, thus showing that the behavior described in bug report 21059 was fixed elsewhere in the code and that PR 21059 is not needed.  There have been other bug reports about the side-effects and nuisance of binding mod_speling with a global AcceptPathInfo (e.g, # 38635 [3] and mailing list posts)).  I would strongly advise to remove this dependency and, when resources are available, add a better integration of AcceptPathInfo processing into mod_speling, such as the one done in mod_mime via ModMimeUsePathInfo.

Patch against 2.2.6  Created an attachment (id=20924) removes PR 21059 from mod_speling. Patch against trunk  One thing to add to this report is a rather serious side effect this mod_speling/pathinfo bug inadvertently introduces, infinitely recursive uris.  Clueless crawlers, which are many, do not notice from the ETAG that they are getting is identical to a resource they already indexed.  When parsing a resource for links they accessed with a trailing / and coming across a relative uri they naturally append the relative path to the uri they already have as a resource to crawl.  For example:  http://www.w3.org/INSTALL.html/Library/src/Library/src/ --> 200 OK  http://www.w3.org/INSTALL.html/Library/src/Library/src/Library/src/ --> 200 OK  ad nauseam  Except as perhaps a teergrube exercise to trap and hold hostage unsuspecting crawlers indefinitely this is generally undesirable.

I decided to make a new bug report as I was not sure if it  was OK to reply to one of the points given in the previous report.

Thanks for the patch. Proposed for backport as r593818 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=593818&view=rev). Here's an idea:  These autoindexes should not only be valid markup but promote open standards (valid markup) by linking back to W3C's Validator.  If you are open to the idea it would be ideal if Apache were to include W3C valid markup logos in the /icons directory so as to distribute load of serving those icons on all the new valid autoindex URIs.  In turn we can promote adoption of Apache 2.2, as apparently many are still 1.3, on the Validator's results page eg    http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A//www.w3.org/&doctype=Inline&%20outline=  We could give an alternate markup for Apache instances >2.2.N to all users or perhaps just for sites we detect the Server: header as still Apache 1.3 or 2.0    <p>     <a href='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer'><img         src='/icons/valid-xhtml10'         alt='Valid XHTML 1.0 Strict' height='31' width='88' /></a>   </p> I don't like it. to 2.2 as r596675 <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=596675>			Andr??

43711	null	RESOLVED		Ragini Bisarya	1193407680000	1203698253000		100-continue response when 401 expected General comments -  ---------------- This bug is reproducible.  I have marked it a regression because to works fine in Apache 1.3 but not in Apache 2. Here is the link to the email exchange on users@httpd.apache.org on this issue.  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/apache/users/340314#340314.  Overview Description: --------------------- For PUT requests with a Expect: 100-continue header, Apache 2.2.6 server sends a HTTP/1.1 100 Continue response before checking to see if a 401 or 405 response might need to be sent for the request.   When the resource requires authentication, Apache 2.6 sends a 100 Continue instead of a 401. After the client sends the request body, Apache 2.2.6 returns a 401 and now the client ends up having to send the request body again.  For large request body sending the entire body multiple times defeats the purpose of the continue response stated in the HTTP 1.1 RFC - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.2.3   When a resource does *not* require authentication Apache 2.2.6 and Apache 1.3 both send a 100 Continue as expected and there are no issues there.   Steps to Reproduce:  ---------------------  1-5 are to setup Apache for this test.  1. Create a directory named 'secret' under htdocs. 2. Create a passwords file with user 'test' and a passwd. 3. Create a .htaccess file in the secret directory  My .htaccess had -  AuthType Basic  AuthName 'secret_access'  AuthBasicProvider file  AuthUserFile /opt/apache226/htdocs/.passwd  Require user test  4. Enable PUT method support by adding 'Script PUT /cgi-bin/put.cgi' to the httpd.conf. 5. I used the put script available at - http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/put1 for this test and copied it to the cgi-bin dir.  6. Send the following PUT request to the Apache 2 server.  PUT /secret/test.html HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.10.1:8080 Expect: 100-continue Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2007 20:05:24 GMT Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 49 Content-Type: application/octet-stream    Actual Results : ----------------- HTTP/1.1 100 Continue   Expected Results: ------------------ HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2007 20:05:24 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.6 (Unix) WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm='secret_access' Content-Length: 401 Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive    With Apache 1.3 the complete exchange was as follows -  PUT /secret/test.html HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.10.1:8888 Expect: 100-continue Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2007 22:22:24 GMT Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 49 Content-Type: application/octet-stream   HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2007 22:22:24 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.33 (Unix) WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm='secret_access' Content-Length: 401 Connection: close etc...

The basic problem is that the HTTP protocol input filter (ap_http_filter) actually sends the 100-continue.  That's way too early.  I think the fix should be to remove that code from the protocol filter, and send the 100 response from a fixups hook.  Bug me if I don't get around to doing anything about it. Created an attachment (id=21053) Patch against trunk  Can you please check if the attached patch solves your problem? Thanks for the patch.   I patched in the change to the Apache 2.2.6 source code version. And it did not work as I expected it to. The server sent both a 401 AND a 100 response for the PUT request!  Next I will pull the trunk version of the source code to test this patch and let you know the results.   For 2.2.6 you also need to apply the patch for PR38014 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=574950) which has been already backported to 2.2.x. Thus it worked for me. Results of testing this using the trunk version of the source code + the patch.  A 401 was returned instead of the 100 continue, so that is good. But when the PUT request with the auth header was sent by the client on that connection, the server's state seemed to be all wrong.  Looking at the hex dump of the 401 response returned by the server, it looks like the last chunk of the response (the 401 response has Transfer-encoding = chunked) with 0 length and the CRLF was not sent by the server so the 401 response sent by the server is actually incomplete.  Test 1 - PUT request for resource that requires authentication - Result is NOT OK  ===> sending the request with out the Auth header PUT /secret/test.html HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.10.1:8080 Expect: 100-continue Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2007 20:05:24 GMT Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 49 Content-Type: application/octet-stream   HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required Date: Tue, 30 Oct 2007 00:04:18 GMT Server: Apache/2.3.0-dev (Unix) WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm='secret_access' Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1  192 <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC '-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN'> <html><head> <title>401 Authorization Required</title> </head><body> <h1>Authorization Required</h1> <p>This server could not verify that you are authorized to access the document requested.

Looks like even though a 401 was sent out, the server is in some weird state. If the client sends two CRs at this point this results in the server sending back a 0 length chunk.  Trying a GET request on this server confirmed that this server does send a correct and complete 401 in the case of GET as shown below.

43738	null	CLOSED		Garrett Wollman	1193756220000	1194232817000		Who is hiding my buffered POST data from mod_ssl after renegotiation? These logs show a connection to a FastCGI server in a directory which requires SSL renegotiation.  mod_fastcgi uses the deprecated ap_get_client_block() family  to read POST data from the client, but rewriting it to use the underlying Apache 2 APIs shows identical results.  I've deleted a few lines that aren't relevant to this analysis...  [Tue Oct 30 16:41:47 2007] [info] [client 128.30.28.20] Connection to child 9 established (server courses.csail.mit.edu:443) ...

In fact, the server thinks it should be passing client data, but when ap_get_client_block() attempts to read the client data, it gets an EOS.  More interestingly, an examination of the input_filter chain at that point shows 'http_in' followed by 'ssl/tls filter'; I believe the second (or maybe the first) filter here should be 'ssl/tls buffer' instead.  (We know from the two previous lines that the POST content has been successfully buffered.)  The buffer does eventually get read, as the following log entries show -- but not by mod_fastcgi.  The very last thing that ssl_io_buffer_fill() does is add the 'ssl/tls buffer' filter, so I don't understand why it doesn't appear at the head of the input filter list when ap_get_client_block() is running, nor why it does get read (and presumably is in the filter chain) after the request is aborted.

The filter chain is correct; r->remaining is 525 which matches the number of bytes the SSL buffer captured.  I can't see why this would fail, and I can't think what else to suggest here other than stepping through the code to see what is happening, or adding a lot of ap_log_rerror() debugging calls in ap_get_client_block()/ap_http_filter().    - is this ap_get_client_block() call happening *before* the timeout? - does ap_get_client_block() fail? - the topmost filter is ap_http_filter - breakpoint on that; does it get invoked?  step through; what does it do?   What makes you say that the filter chain is correct?  I would expect the 'ssl/tls buffer' filter to be at the head to the chain, since that's where all the data is being buffered.  There's no chance that reading from 'ssl/tls filter' will give me any data since its data has already been read and stored in the buffer.  To answer your questions: >- is this ap_get_client_block() call happening *before* the timeout?  Yes, I thought I made that clear in my analysis.  >- does ap_get_client_block() fail?  No, as I said before, it returns end-of-stream (0).  I haven't traced through ap_http_filter; however, in the course of instrumenting ap_get_client_block() before I filed this bug, I made it skip over 'http_in' and read directly from 'ssl/tls filter'.  Same result: end of stream.  (In reply to comment #4) > What makes you say that the filter chain is correct?

There's no chance that reading from 'ssl/tls > filter' will give me any data since its data has already been read and stored in > the buffer.  It is correct. You have to read the whole thing as a stack:   http_in(0x826c98):          HTTP filter: Does dechunking if transfer-encoding of                              the body is chunked or reads up to Content-length                             bytes from the body. ssl/tls filter(0x81e098):   Does decryption of the input stream and deals with                             client certificates. Sometimes this filter buffers                             data. log_input_output(0x8109f0): Counts bytes that came in. core_in(0x81e140):          Core network connection to the raw socket.  >ssl/tls filter(0x81e098):   Does decryption of the input stream and deals with >                            client certificates. Sometimes this filter buffers >                            data.  That's not what the code claims.  See the end of ssl_io_buffer_fill() in ssl_engine_io.c:      /* Insert the filter which will supply the buffered data. */     ap_add_input_filter(ssl_io_buffer, ctx, r, c);      return 0;  The buffered data can only come from the 'ssl/tls buffer' filter, not the 'ssl/tls filter' filter.  As I noted in my original report, we know from the debug logs that the 'ssl/tls buffer' filter's read routine (ssl_io_filter_buffer) is in fact being called, but not until after the 30-second timeout. Created an attachment (id=21077) test fix  Sorry, I read the filter stack wrong; I was only looking to check that http_in was at the top; the second filter down should be the buffering filter not the normal SSL filter (they are separate filters).  I note that r->prev is set here so an internal redirect will have happened.  And that will filters < AP_FTYPE_PROTOCOL, which includes this one... oops.  Can you try this fix? should read: ^And that will kill filters < AP_FTYPE_PROTOCOL Ah, no, that won't work at all.  The buffering filter is AP_FTYPE_PROTOCOL - 1 exactly because it the fill_buffer reads from r->proto_input_filters.  Ick.  I can't see any obvious fix here.  To confirm the diagnosis can you reproduce without whatever triggered the internal redirect? > To confirm the diagnosis can you reproduce without whatever triggered the > internal redirect?  Can you suggest how I might figure out what that was?  For what it's worth, ssl_io_filter_buffer() is eventually called from ap_discard_request_body() after mod_fastcgi gives up.  > To confirm the diagnosis can you reproduce without whatever triggered the > internal redirect?  I think I figured it out.  This problem is not seen by mod_php4 applications, nor by regular CGI applications.  The internal redirect is caused by mod_action, which is used to implement PHP5 under FastCGI.  The configuration looks like this:  FastCgiServer /usr/bin/php5-cgi -processes 5 ScriptAlias /.php5-cgi /usr/bin/php5-cgi <Directory /usr/bin>   Order deny,allow   Deny from all   <Files php5-cgi>     Options ExecCGI     SetHandler fastcgi-script     Order allow,deny     Allow from all   </Files> </Directory> Action php5-script /.php5-cgi Action application/x-httpd-fastphp5 /.php5-cgi  Then in .htaccess, users who want php5 instead of php4 specify:  AddHandler php5-script .php  I don't see how your conf is triggering an internal redirect?  Can you differentiate if this is a fast-internal redirect or a straight redirect?  Is this because the client requests /app/Login instead of requesting /app/Login.php ?  > Can you differentiate if this is a fast-internal redirect or a straight > redirect?  Not sure I know what that means.  Here is what the two request_rec structures look like.  Note that the first one is generated in mod_actions by calling ap_internal_redirect_handler() and the second one is the original request:  (gdb) p *r $2 = {pool = 0x839398, connection = 0x80ba98, server = 0x6ce468, next = 0x0,    prev = 0x839408, main = 0x0,    the_request = 0x83a9c0 'GET /16.410/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Preferences HTTP/1.1', assbackwards = 0, proxyreq = 0, header_only = 0,    protocol = 0x83aac0 'HTTP/1.1', proto_num = 1001,    hostname = 0x83aeb8 'more-courses.csail.mit.edu',    request_time = 1193938941817986, status_line = 0x44efd3 '200 OK',    status = 200, method = 0x83aa10 'GET', method_number = 0, allowed = 0,    allowed_xmethods = 0x0, allowed_methods = 0x81d928, sent_bodyct = 1,    bytes_sent = 8192, mtime = 0, chunked = 1, range = 0x0, clength = 0,    remaining = 0, read_length = 0, read_body = 1, read_chunked = 0,    expecting_100 = 0, headers_in = 0x8396e8, headers_out = 0x861668,    err_headers_out = 0x83a030, subprocess_env = 0x85af28, notes = 0x81d788,    content_type = 0x861450 'text/html;

43882	null	RESOLVED		Bj	1195186200000	1197095725000		Multiple Transfer-Encodings in requests handled improperly Requests using multiple transfer encodings are handled as if they had no  Transfer-Encoding header and no entity body. For example:    POST / HTTP/1.1   Transfer-Encoding: gzip,chunked   [more headers]    [body]  Here Apache would treat [body] as if it was the beginning of a new request.  This is incorrect, RFC 2616 allows requests of this kind and recommends to  respond with Not Implemented if the Transfer-Encoding is not understood; the  alternative would be to treat it as if it had 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' and  let request handlers remove the other transfer encodings if they so wish though  this would probably require some opt-in feature to avoid feeding garbage to  unsuspecting handlers.  The specific code seems to tbe in http_filters.c ap_http_filter(...) which only goes into BODY_CHUNK mode if 'chunked' is the only encoding. There also  does not seem to be lexical checking performed on the value. RFC 2616 requires  that 'chunk' occurs at most once in the value and if it does, occurs at the end  of the list. Apache should probably respond with Bad Request if that is not the  case (to avoid confusing request handlers taking care of the decoding if that  is made an option).	Fixed in trunk in r595672. From the latest version:              /* RFC2616 allows qualifiers, so use strncasecmp */             if (!strncasecmp(tenc, 'chunked', 7) && !ap_strchr_c(tenc, ',')) {                 ctx->state = BODY_CHUNK;             }             else {                 /* Something that isn't in HTTP, unless some future                  * edition defines new transfer ecodings, is unsupported.                  */  I am a bit worried, I am unsure what 'qualifiers' refers to and the code below  seems to match on 'Transfer-Encoding: chunkedfoo' which it should not. And the  original example 'Transfer-Encoding: gzip,chunked' is 'in HTTP', Apache just  does not support it. So shouldn't this be something like              if (!strcasecmp(tenc, 'chunked')) {                 ctx->state = BODY_CHUNK;             }             else {                 /* Other Transfer-Encodings are not implemented */  Bj??rn, this is turning into discussion, and as such should be on dev@httpd, not bugzilla.  Do you follow that?  1.  Qualifiers come from the BNF-style representation of the header, which means something like Transfer-Encoding: chunked;foo=bar is syntactically valid.  But in practice, no qualifiers are defined.  2.  gzip is a content-encoding, not a transfer-encoding.  The passage in RFC2616 that suggests otherwise is clearly a drafter who'd been staring at it too long, and had a brainfart.  3.  You're right about 'chunkedfoo' - I'll fix it.  If noone shouts, I'll just set it back to strcasecmp, so we don't support any qualifiers.  As it happens, I'd already realised it wasn't right, but just wasn't rushing the job again:-)  Thank you for your attention to detail. Ah you meant parameters, they are indeed allowed, but not knowing what to do  with them they didn't seem to affect the issue. I don't follow the development  list, but I also have nothing to add if you do 3., except to point out that you  are wrong about gzip not being a Transfer-Encoding... Fixed in r602470.			Bj	Nick Kew
43889	null	RESOLVED		Dr Stephen Henson	1195279140000	1195623459000		t log OpenSSL associated error string data When mod_ssl logs OpenSSL errors it doesn't include the associated error string. This string can carry additional data related to the error making the cause easier to locate. In some cases (e.g. the OpenSSL ASN1 library) omitting the error string renders the error output almost useless.  The attached patch fixes this.	Created an attachment (id=21141) Log associated error string  The man page for ERR_get_error_line_data() implies that you have to check for flags&ERR_TXT_MALLOCED and free the 'data' string if true - but the fact that data is passed as const char * somewhat contradicts that - what's correct here? The manual page is a bit confusing in that respect. Almost all applications just call ERR_print_errors() and forget about it, that isn't of course possible here.  The data will be freed internally when the circular buffer is reused (e.g. by more errors or explicitly cleared).  If you free up the data explicitly it wont reset the internal flags and data so you'd end up with the data being freed twice.  Now I've checked the sources in more detail there is a simpler way to achieve the same thing and free up the data properly: peek the error first and call ERR_get_error() afterwards. New patch included. Created an attachment (id=21151) Updated associated error print patch.  Great, thanks.  I also took the opportunity to tweak the log message to delineate the error/data/annotation better; committed to trunk:  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=597077			Dr Stephen Henson	Joe Orton

Created an attachment (id=21220) Fix the XSS  For a host of reasons, this is generally not exploitable in any usual case, and would represent a very unusual client.  Quoting the 'vulnerability' report;  'This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the target site,  or the redirection of confidential information (i.e. session IDs) to unauthorised  third parties provided that a web browser is tricked to submit a malformed HTTP  method.'  Given that this is nonsense in the context of a web browser, no CVE will be assigned, but thank you for the report, it is a bug worth fixing.  Proposed for backport to 2.2 and 2.0.

44073	null	RESOLVED		yl	1197529440000	1197679476000		SSL client certificate extensions parsing bug The following code in httpd-2.2.6/modules/ssl/ssl_expr_eval.c assume a nul-terminated string which isn't (always) :  apr_array_header_t *ssl_extlist_by_oid(request_rec *r, const char *oidstr) { <snip>            BIO *bio = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());             if (X509V3_EXT_print(bio, ext, 0, 0) == 1) {                 BUF_MEM *buf;                 char **new = apr_array_push(val_array);                  BIO_get_mem_ptr(bio, &buf);                  *new = apr_pstrdup(r->pool, buf->data);             } <snip>     if (val_array->nelts == 0)         return NULL;     else         return val_array; }  Neither X509V3_EXT_print() nor BIO_get_mem_ptr() nul-terminate the BIO buffer, so 'buf->data' should be used in the limit of 'buf->length', that is :      *new = apr_pstrndup(r->pool, buf->data, buf->length);  When SSLRequire is used with OIDs, the server can crash (exploitable?), or the certificate extensions requirements can be bypassed since the value may contain arbitrary trailing data.	Sorry, httpd-2.2.6 is concerned by this bug, not the version 2.0.61 which doesn't implement the certificate OIDs requirements.  I want to submit a patch on httpd-2.0.61 for this to be handled, hence my confusion. Proposed patch for inclusion to 2.2.x in r604012 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/STATUS?r1=604012&r2=604011&pathrev=604012) Ok for the patch in 2.2.x, but the problem is there in trunk too :            *ptr = apr_pstrmemdup(p, buf->data, buf->length); This will not create a nul-terminated string either, while it is supposed to, I suggest to use apr_strndup here too.  Should I open a new ticket for trunk ? Trunk changes in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=289444 has moved the problem described above in httpd-trunk/modules/ssl/ssl_engine_vars.c, function ssl_ext_list() pstrmemdup does NUL-terminate the returned string. Included in 2.2.x per r604403 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=604403&view=rev). Sorry, I didn't notice that, the name drove me wrong. Thanks for the patch.			Joe Orton	Ruediger Pluem	yl

[Joe Orton]   Created an attachment (id=21331) http_etags change when reversed solves regression  Just another quick note. From looking at the debug.log with 2.2.6, the last-modified date is 1 second behind the Date header.  With 2.2.7-dev, the dates are equal.  I'm am unsure how the patch effects the dates to cause the Weak ETag in 2.2.7-dev as it does not apparently change any date fields only reads them.  I have run the tests many times to ensure it is not a timing issue.  The date issue and Etag I mentioned is a red herring.  Here the test is succedding on 2.2.7-dev with the 64bit etag patches reversed (Dates are equal and ETag is weak - so not related).  Must be one of the 64 bits casts is putting garbage in the Etag making the condition fail.

It is caused by www.hotels.com sending a Connection: Transfer-Encoding header in its response. This is IMHO unusual (Transfer-Encoding is a hop-by-hop header anyway), but allowed. This causes httpd to remove Transfer-Encoding too early during its internal processing and thus disables it from processing the chunked response.

First guess for your last crash in comment #4 (all line numbers 2.2.8):  lr->accept_func(&csd, lr, ptrans); (line 742 in worker.c) fails with rv != APR_SUCCESS, but with a non NULL value for csd. In contrast to the code in prefork we don't check this situation:  Lines 621 - 631 of prefork.c:          status = lr->accept_func(&csd, lr, ptrans);          SAFE_ACCEPT(accept_mutex_off());      /* unlock after 'accept' */          if (status == APR_EGENERAL) {             /* resource shortage or should-not-occur occured */             clean_child_exit(1);         }         else if (status != APR_SUCCESS) {             continue;         }  Maybe we need to do a continue in the worker case as well or we need to do something like the following:  Index: server/mpm/worker/worker.c =================================================================== --- server/mpm/worker/worker.c  (Revision 627576) +++ server/mpm/worker/worker.c  (Arbeitskopie) @@ -743,6 +743,9 @@              /* later we trash rv and rely on csd to indicate success/failure */              AP_DEBUG_ASSERT(rv == APR_SUCCESS || !csd);  +            if (rv != APR_SUCCESS) { +                csd = NULL; +            }              if (rv == APR_EGENERAL) {                  /* E[NM]FILE, ENOMEM, etc */                  resource_shortage = 1;     I did the stress test with the patch you suggested. After your patch, I still got the 1st crash. If it crashed in second stack trace then I will update the bug.  Here are some more information about 1st crash. * I am able to reproduce the crash on Solaris 10 update 1 (on a different   machine) too. It took around 4 hours of stress before I got the crash on   Solaris 10 while it takes around < 30 minutes to reproduce on Solaris nevada.   It was crash 1 (allocator_free with node = null) (without your patch).

What is happenning some cases is that active->next points to some thing else and active->ref still points to active->next.  I put a printf of active->next before it is set to NULL. For a particular crash, here is my debugging session. I found that active->next was set to 0x20e8810 before it was set to NULL.

The crash always happen in 4th invocation. It seems to me that it gets corrupted somewhere after the 3rd invocation (after it returns from ap_core_output_filter) and before it enters into ap_core_output_filter 4th time (when ap_lingering_close is in call stack). Also conn->keepalives was always set to 1.  With Ruediger patch, I still got the crash (#2).

I guess it is used by two threads in parallel which could lead to a corruption since pools as such are not thread safe. So I think a good starting point for further investigations would be   ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler in mpm/worker/fdqueue.c  or the lines 731 - 740 in worker.c:              if (ptrans == NULL) {                 /* we can't use a recycled transaction pool this time.                  * create a new transaction pool */                 apr_allocator_t *allocator;                  apr_allocator_create(&allocator);                 apr_allocator_max_free_set(allocator, ap_max_mem_free);                 apr_pool_create_ex(&ptrans, pconf, NULL, allocator);                 apr_allocator_owner_set(allocator, ptrans);             }   Thanks Ruediger for your suggestion.

Have you checked if the crashes happen with the same Solaris version on x86? Background of the question: ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler uses atomics whose implementation depends on the hardware architecture. Non functional atomics could be a source for concurrency problems under load. (In reply to comment #10) > As you wrote Solaris on Sun I suppose you mean on SPARC. Have you checked if the > crashes happen with the same Solaris version on x86? Background of the question:  Oops my fault: You already said that you are using x86. Nevertheless does the same happen on SPARC with the same Solaris version or if you compile with  --enable-nonportable-atomics=no ?  Thanks Ruediger for your pointer. It was really useful.  Regarding the function : ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler (lines 188-196) 188:        struct recycled_pool *first_pool = queue_info->recycled_pools; 189:        if (first_pool == NULL) { 190:            break; 191:        } 192:        if (apr_atomic_casptr((volatile void**)&(queue_info->recycled_pools), first_pool->next, 193:                              first_pool) == first_pool) { 194:            *recycled_pool = first_pool->pool; 195:            break; 196:        }  I will represent queue_info->receycled_pools as qu->rp to make it make it short.  Inside apr_atomic_casptr we acquire a mutex. So I will write 3 steps : 1. Calcualte first_pool. 2. Calculate first_pool->next and invoke apr_atomic_caspptr 3. Acquire lock on qi->rp (inside apr_atomic_casptr)  There is a very clear race condition between the two statement (line 188 and line 193) and between step 2 & 3. Though I agree that &queue_info->recycled_pool is protected and it is atomically correct but the next pointer (first_pool and first_pool->next) are not protected correctly. There is a very clear race condition between the two. To prove my point, here is an example :  Suppose at a particular moment recycled_pool pool list is  1 --> 2 ---> 3 . Where 1,2,3 are the pool nodes. qi->rp = 1. Now consider the following situation : Thread 1 :     first_pool = 1;     first_pool->next = 2.      Now before step 3 is executed that is before we acquire a lock on qi->rp, context switch happens.  Thread 2 :     Thread 2 pops a node (1) from the list and hence list becomes 2->3.  Thread 3 :     Thread 3 pops another node (2) from the list and hence list becomes 3.  Thread 2 :     push the node back and now list becomes 1->3.  Thread 1:     first->pool->next = 2.  qi->rp is still 1.  Thread acquires a lock &1 and atomically compare and swap with 2. It succeeded because qi->rp was 1 but qi->rp->next was not 3, it becomes 2 and hence queue becomes 2 (or 2-->3).          I believe, I can prove my point with a sample standalone application. So far I used a separate mutex and protected both qi->rp and qi->rp->next both.  I tried with the attached patch. With this patch, I am able to run the stress for more than 10 hour without any crash. Without this patch, crash used to happen in less than 30 minutes.

We have a similar race in the event MPM. Next steps:  1. Bring your patch above into trunk. Currently I see no significant performance     loss over the current code as we are using a mutex there as well. We only    increase the time during which we lock the resource. I don't know right    now when I find the cycles to apply the patch to trunk, but if you could    attach a trunk version of your patch to this report it would be a big help.  2. Move the further discussion regarding options a) or b) to     dev@httpd.apache.org and lets wait for its results to decide how to move     along and improve the situation here in the long run.    I think I have to correct myself in two points.  1. On APR trunk there are better implementations for apr_atomic_casptr which no     longer use a mutex, but native platform processor / OS features. So in     contrast to my first assumption there could be a performance degradation by    your patch on trunk, which would be bad.  2. The race scenario you described cannot happen in this way, because it assumes    that multiple threads pop pools from the list in parallel. This is not the     case as only the listener thread does this. What happens in parallel are:     - Multiple pushes to the list    - (Multiple) pushes to the list and a pop  OTOH I still believe that there is some kind of race scenario as your patch showed that the error goes away if the locking / syncing is changed here. So maybe its only a different scenario (that I haven't figured out so far) or there is a bug in apr_atomic_casptr. Do the same crashes happen with trunk?     Regarding the example given in comments # 12, I need to correct myself. I agree with you that the example is not valid for worker implementation because there is single thread which pop the nodes and multiple threads which pushes the node.  ( ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler is not thread safe but it is not called by multiple threads. It is only invoked by single listener_thread. )  I could not yet think of any race condition in which single popping thread and several pushing thread cause recycle_pool list corruption.  I am still working on it to find the real cause of the crashes.    Few more updates :  * Probably these crashes also exist on Linux (64 bit). But I can't say for sure. I saw 3 crashes so far. Out of 3, I get core dump only once and stack trace from that core dump didn't seem much sense to me so I can't say for sure that the bug reproduces on Linux or not. (Linux is 64 bit Fedora 8 with 64 bit apache).   On Solaris, I tried the following things : * Replaced apr_atomic_casptr with solaris's atomic_casptr. But the result remained the same. I still saw the crashes. This means that this may not be the apr bug. * If I replace apr_atomic_casptr code but keep the for loop then  the crashes disappear. ---------------------------------- ap_queue_info_set_idle-------------             if (apr_atomic_casptr((volatile void**)&(queue_info->recycled_pools),                                   new_recycle, new_recycle->next) ==                 new_recycle->next) {                 break;             } ---------------------------------- replace with -----------------------             rv = apr_thread_mutex_lock(queue_info->queue_mutex);             if (queue_info->recycled_pools == new_recycle->next) {                 queue_info->recycled_pools = new_recycle;                 success = 1;             }             rv = apr_thread_mutex_unlock(queue_info->queue_mutex);   ---------------------------------- ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler --------------         if (apr_atomic_casptr((volatile void**)&(queue_info->recycled_pools), first_pool->next,                               first_pool) == first_pool) {             *recycled_pool = first_pool->pool;             break;         } ---------------------------------- replace with ---------------------------         rv = apr_thread_mutex_lock(queue_info->queue_mutex);         if (queue_info->recycled_pools == first_pool) {             queue_info->recycled_pools = next;             success = 1;         }         rv = apr_thread_mutex_unlock(queue_info->queue_mutex); ----------------------------------  Created an attachment (id=21581) Patch for httpd-2.2.8  Eventually I figured out where is the real race condition.  Lines fdqueue.c:96-102 (in httpd-2.2.8) \tfor (;;) { \t    new_recycle->next = queue_info->recycled_pools; \t    if (apr_atomic_casptr((volatile void**)&(queue_info->recycled_pools), \t\t\t\t  new_recycle, new_recycle->next) == \t\tnew_recycle->next) { \t\tbreak; \t    } \t}  The race condition is between return of apr_atomic_casptr and calculating new_recycle->next.  Let us write the look into three steps (qi->rp is queue_info->recycled_pools): 1. Set new_recycle->next to qi->rp 2. atomically compare and swap qi->rp with new_recycle if matches with     new_recycle->next. 3. Calculate new_recycle->next again. 4. Determine the call apr_atomic_casptr is successful based on the return value and    result of step 3.  The race condition is in between step2 and step3. If apr_atomic_casptr was successful (it means it successfully swapped the value) and If there is a context switch between 2 and 3 then new_recycle->next can point to something else and can also be corrupted. The result of which is that if condition will fail.  I saved the new_recycle->next in a local variable and then used the local variable as shown in the patch and the issue got resolved.  Here is the example how new_recycle->next can be changed by a race condition : Suppose our list is 1-->2-->3, where 1,2,3 are list nodes. Now suppose worker thread 1 wants to add a node 4 to it's head. Here is how it goes :  ----------------------------------------------------------- Worker thread 1 :    new_recycle = 4;    qi->rp = 1;    new_recycle->next = 1;    apr_atomic_casptr successfully compare and swap it with qi->rp that means    qi->rp = 4;     (list now becomes 4-->1-->2-->3)     Now context switch happens :  Listener_thread :     qi->rp is 4 and hence it pops the node 4 and gives it to worker thread 2.    The list becomes 1-->2-->3.     Listener thread pops another node and give it worker thread 3 and now list    becomes 2-->3.  Worker thread 2 :    Returns the node 4 into the list and list becomes 4-->2-->3.  Worker thread 1 :    new_recycle->next now becomes 2 and it compares with 1 and hence comparision fails. -----------------------------------------------------------     Real situations can be little different than what I described because before  worker thread returns node 4 to the list, pool is cleared (line 897 of worker.c, in worker_thread function ) \tapr_pool_clear(ptrans); \tlast_ptrans = ptrans;  which means new_recycle->next will be corrupted and point to a deleted value.  How I figured out this is that if you put a assert statement like : \t    struct recycled_pool *next = queue_info->recycled_pools; \t    new_recycle->next = next; \t    if (apr_atomic_casptr((volatile void**)&(queue_info->recycled_pools), \t\t\t\t  new_recycle, new_recycle->next) == next) { \t\tap_assert(next == new_recycle->next); \t\tbreak; \t    } then assertion fails under stress situations.  The bug also exist in event mpm too (server/mpm/experimental/event/fdqueue.c).  Ruediger, can you review the patch? The patch is against 2.2.8. Should I submit  patch against trunk?  Since the crash happens on linux too so I am changing the summary. Created an attachment (id=21582) Revised patch  Made small correction in comments of patch. Fixed in trunk in r630335. Great work Basant. Nick beat me to committing your patch, but in the meantime I applied your patch to the event MPM on trunk as well (r630348). *** Bug 44474 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Backported to 2.2.x as r631362 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=631362&view=rev). *** Bug 42086 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***			Basant Kumar Kukreja	Nick Kew	Ruediger Pluem

(In reply to comment #2) > This looks like a bug in IE 7 for me. It doesn't seem to translate the > characters correctly to unicode (or fails to select the correct font). For > example, the title looks fine in firefox 2 /linux (German locale).  No, this is not an IE bug. Charset of Japanese HTMLs is EUC-JP, but Japanese HTMLs contain ISO-8859-1. I opens them with many text editor, and they are garbled. Firefox actually shows it correctly. I think Firefox has special handler for EUC-JP-ISO-8859-1-mixed text.  I checked Korean file, and found that it contains numeric character references.  <a href='./es/install.html' hreflang='es' rel='alternate' title='Espa&#241;ol'>&nbsp;es&nbsp;</a> | <a href='./fr/install.html' hreflang='fr' rel='alternate' title='Fran&#231;ais'>&nbsp;fr&nbsp;</a> |  Why do XSLT processors convert numeric character references to raw data for Japanese HTML files? I don't have deep knowledge about XML and XSLT... Created an attachment (id=21768) make Japanese HTML UTF-8 against trunk  Japanese character and alphabets with diacritic cannot live together in EUC-JP.  You're right. I'm sure, I saw HTML character references somewhere in ja files. So it seems to be actually java problem then.  I'm gonna take the ja.xml part of your patch, run "build.sh bootstrap" and move the files around.  Thanks for your care. trunk is already synced to the live server, the other branches are coming soon.			Andr?? Malo	Takashi Sato
