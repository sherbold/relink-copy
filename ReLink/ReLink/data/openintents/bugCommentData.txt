170	isaac.jo...@gmail.com	1232065104000	This is so that remote applications might detect the user's preference and ask them if they'd like to change it if they want to continue using this application.  
170	peli0...@googlemail.com	1232131276000	I think this should be handled by OI Safe itself.  It should prompt the user for granting external access.

197	peli0...@googlemail.com	1233251317000	Fixed in r1878.  It was good to reproduce this bug in the emulator:  ------ Randy: Here's the steps on the emulator I do:  1.  Open OI Safe, unlock it, leave it on CategoryList  2.  Click on the power off button in the lower right.  3.  Wait for the OI Safe timeout, you can see it happen in the debug.  01-29 20:01:12.020: DEBUG/IntentHandler(1842): onResume()  01-29 20:01:12.349: DEBUG/IntentHandler(1842): onPause()  01-29 20:01:12.550: DEBUG/ServiceDispatchIMPL(1842): onCreate  4. Click on the power on button.  In the debug you'll see:  01-29 20:02:28.290: DEBUG/IntentHandler(1842): onResume()  5.  Hit Menu key to unlock the Keyguard.  01-29 20:03:21.770: DEBUG/KeyguardViewMediator(53): pokeWakelock(5000)  6. OI Safe will be displayed, presumably IntentHandler is running.   
197	isaac.jo...@gmail.com	1233283562000	This same behavior occurs in the following instance - reopening:  1. Make sure OI Safe is locked, and that &quot;allow external access&quot; is disabled. 2. go to OI Notepad and create a new note, encrypt it. 3. You should be redirected to log into OI Safe. 4. You should be asked by OI Safe if you want to allow external access (bug: You are asked twice?) 5. After allowing, you get the blank screen, with OI Safe running

207	peli0...@googlemail.com	1233908253000	Fixed in r1927.  It has nothing to do with going from version 1.0.2 to 1.1.0, but with screen  orientation change in the edit tag dialog. It did not keep the Uri in a bundle.    
210	rmce...@gmail.com	1234687620000	I've seen this error as well.  Unfortunately I'm not able to create a series of steps to follow in order to duplicate it at will.  This error is emitted from AskPassword.java and IntentHandler.java. 
210	rmce...@gmail.com	1236204352000	Possibly fixed in r1967.  kanisdragon, I only just saw your comment.   Thanks for digging into it.   Please do an svn update and try my release.   If what you say is true, than my understanding of finish() is flawed.   I understand that when finish() is called, that it behaves like a return;  Were you ever able to reproduce the bug on demand?  I wasn't.  So I just added some checks in IntentHandler to see if salt was empty or null.   If finish() doesn't immediately return, I think it'd be better in CategoryList to do the same check salt for null or empty.  Since adding the check I haven't seen the salt error on my phone.   But I could just be getting lucky as of late.  :) 
210	rmce...@gmail.com	1236245000000	Sure enough, you're right!  I poked around in the ApiDemos and they absolutely stick a return; in where it's appropriate.  I've updated all finish() calls to have a return;.   Plus I ran through every activity and ensured that the onCreate() and onResume() had the appropriate check for isSignedIn().  For a couple of activities I needed to create an onResume() to even check, but they should all have it now.  Please check out the latest revision 1972.   Your feedback is great, thank you.  
210	rmce...@gmail.com	1236674303000	I've seen the oddity where you screen off/on but the key icon is still in the notification as if the safe is unlocked, but when you launch the safe it still asks for the password.   More of an annoying bug.   I can't duplicate it on command.  The second oddity I have not seen and cannot duplicate.

217	rmce...@gmail.com	1236677099000	Also fails with PassView. 
217	rmce...@gmail.com	1253625914000	Fixed with r2293 
218	peli0...@googlemail.com	1236680795000	Related problem: Once an item is edited after the screen orientation has changed, it  appears twice in the shopping list. (Without screen orientation while the dialog is  open, the item is simply modified as expected - not duplicated).

231	peli0...@googlemail.com	1261154086000	Fixed in r2405. Will be public in release v1.2.0. 
232	peli0...@googlemail.com	1245635105000	Good suggestion.  The RelativeLayout used currently would have to be replaced by (less performant) nested LinearLayouts (as it actually was originally - before this blog post suggested a change: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/02/android-layout-tricks-1.html )  Or does anyone see a way how to achieve this within RelativeLayout? 
232	peli0...@googlemail.com	1261391603000	Fixed in r2420. Will be available in upcoming version 1.2.0. 
233	peli0...@googlemail.com	1264663672000	Fixed in r2511. Will be available in OI Notepad 1.1.4. 
236	rmce...@gmail.com	1259399704000	Unable to duplicate in OI Safe 1.2.3. 
236	peli0...@googlemail.com	1261473136000	I also can not reproduce this in 1.2.4.  I'll mark it as fixed for now. Please bump if the problem still exists.

282	friedger	1276072047000	Looks like the mExtraItems are not cleared.  If the scanned item is edited the product appears twice, once in the original form (as in mExtraItems) one in the edited form. 
282	friedger	1276121537000	It only occurs if the shopping list is started from the plugin, if started from home screen, all works fine. Ergo, the intent action has to be changed after the items have been inserted to avoid duplicate insertion.
